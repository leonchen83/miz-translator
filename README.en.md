DCS Mission Translator is a tool designed to translate DCS mission files into Chinese, Japanese, or Korean.
It extracts text from mission files, uses AI to perform the translation, and then writes the translated content back into the original mission file.

## Usage

### Installation

First, you need to install Java 17. You can download and install Java 17 from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17-windows).

Next, download the latest version of the mission translator. You can get the latest release from [here](https://github.com/leonchen83/miz-translator/releases/download/v1.0.4/miz-translator-release.zip). Extract it to `/path/to/miz-translator`.

### Configuration

In the `/path/to/miz-translator/conf` directory, there is a file named `trans.conf`. You can configure the translator using this file.

```properties
# Prompt for the AI; here "F/A 18" is an example. You can modify the aircraft type or campaign as needed.
hint=You are a translator. The following English texts are related to the F/A 18 fighter jet. Translate them into Simplified Chinese without using markdown formatting. Keep the original line breaks and do not add extra explanations. Preserve acronyms written in uppercase.

# AI translators supported: deepseek, doubao, and openai
translator=deepseek

# API Key for the translator. If using deepseek or doubao, you must fill in your API Key here.
apikey=your-api-key

# Base URL for the Open API
baseurl=https://api.deepseek.com/v1

# AI model to use
model=deepseek-chat

# Temperature for the AI. Use a negative value for the default.
temperature=1.3

# Max tokens for the AI; default is 4096
maxTokens=4096

# Minimum text length to trigger translation; texts shorter than 12 characters will be kept as-is
minimumLength=12

# Phrases to exclude from translation. Use multiple filters, each starting with 'filters'
filters1=JAMMER COOLING
filters2=INSERT ON COURSE AUDIO

# Keys to exclude from translation. Use multiple keyFilters, each starting with 'keyFilters'
keyFilters1=DictKey_UnitName_
keyFilters2=DictKey_WptName_
keyFilters3=DictKey_GroupName_
keyFilters4=DictKey_ActionRadioText_
````

### Run

```shell
cd /path/to/miz-translator/bin
./trans -f /path/to/missions
```

Here, `/path/to/miz-translator/bin` is the path to the extracted folder, and `/path/to/missions` is the path to the mission file you want to translate.

### Step-by-Step Mode

```shell
# You can also run it step by step
cd /path/to/miz-translator/bin

# Extract text from the mission file into a JSON file
./trans -f /path/to/missions -d

# Translate the JSON file
./trans -f /path/to/missions -t

# Compress the translated text back into a .miz mission file
./trans -f /path/to/missions -c
```
