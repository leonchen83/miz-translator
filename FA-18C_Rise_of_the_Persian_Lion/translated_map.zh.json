  "IN THIS VERSION OF THE CAMPAIGN YOU MUST BE OVERHEAD  SUKHUMI AT TIME 15:20 ZULU AND OVERHEAD SENAKI AT TIME 15:29 ZULU.  YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS LATITUDE BEFORE AND AFTER THESE DISPLAY TIMES.\n\n1.    Both yourself and \"Wave\" your wingman, \"Ford Group\", have been booked the 19.00 event for launch from the Stennis. \"Wave\" in 410 will leave first and you \"Ford\" in 110 will follow. 410 will join up once you are airborne. REMAIN AT 300KNTS UNTIL JOIN.\n2.    You will then both head to Sukhumi where you will be carrying out a low-level fly past over runway 1 2 with smoke. KEEP BELOW 480KNTS UNTIL FIRST FLY PAST. \n3.    Once complete you will follow your way points to another low-level fly past at Senaki runway 2 7 once again with smoke.\n4.    You will then head out over the Black Sea and climb to Angels 20 following your waypoints. As you arrive back again over the coast you will set up for your first plug with \"Texaco\" \n5.    Once both of you have successfully completed the plug you will continue en-route.\n6.    Your onward journey will consist of a stop off at Batman air base overnight in Turkey before heading for the Gulf early tomorrow morning.\n\nThis is it, as you subconsciously flick on the Hornet's battery switch, a group of Helos pass close overhead. Axis, a Hornet group are just leaving for their final missions over the Caucasus, the deck is busy and noisy as usual. Thankfully, it is a beautiful day with hardly a cloud in the sky. You look to your right, \"Wave\" 410 gives you the thumbs up, we are out of here . . . \n\nTo complete this mission, you will need to be able to take off from the Stennis by day / Be able to switch smoke on and off / Receive and use Tacan to locate Texaco / Use the radio to contact Texaco / Carry out an air to air refuel with Texaco on the STARBOARD SIDE whilst \"Wave\" refuels on the PORT SIDE.\n\nCOMMS\n\nTexaco : 3150.00  Pri Channel 1 / Tacan 10X    \n\nTIPS\n\n1.    Ensure you have set up a control to activate and deactivate smoke.\n2.    Activate Data Link and SA page.\n3.    \"Wave\" 410 is booked in for first launch and will remain in pattern until you are airborne and then join up. \n4.    Remember you are flying lead with your wingman, give him time to join you, he could well be catching up from a previous holding orbit. CRUISE AT 300KNTS UNTIL JOIN. Then control your speed appropriately throughout the mission with him in mind.\n5.    Joint Refuel: Ensure you refuel with Texaco using the Starboard basket. \"Wave\" will use the Port side whether you are there or not. Use your wingman's approach as a guide to the correct tanker approach speed. IF YOU ARRIVE AT THE TANKER TOO FAR AHEAD OF YOUR WINGMAN, AND HIS FUEL BASKET ON THE TANKERS PORT SIDE IS NOT ALREADY EXTENDED THEN WAIT, DO NOT MAKE YOUR \"READY PRECONTACT\" RADIO CALL UNTIL IT IS. THIS WILL THEN CORRECTLY ACTIVATE YOUR REFUEL BASKET ON THE STARBOARD SIDE.  \n6.    Make sure you have a control set to switch smoke on and off easily as required.\n\nNOTES\n\n1.    Each mission has a kneeboard containing all essential information. Call kneeboard and select back page once. \n2.    You will not be able to locate tankers via Tacan until they have been requested in the mission.      (This by mission design to minimise resources for VR users).\n3.    A lot of the communications are trigger based. Pilots will have to operate the radio for Carrier approaches and aerial refuelling.\n4.    The design of the missions are trigger based and so it is important that you follow the route and any instructions to realise all of the content and pass the mission.\n5.    THE GUARANTEED MISSION BYPASS MECHANISM IS AVAILABLE FOR SELECTION THROUGH THE F10 FUNCTION BUT ONLY FOR THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES OF A MISSION COMMENCING.\n\nGood luck, Enjoy!\n\n18\n" : "在本战役版本中，您必须在祖鲁时间15:20飞越SUKHUMI上空，并在祖鲁时间15:29飞越SENAKI上空。在这些显示时间前后有30秒的宽限。\n\n1.    您和您的僚机\"Wave\"，\"福特小组\"，已预定19.00事件从Stennis起飞。\"Wave\"驾驶410号机将首先离开，您\"Ford\"驾驶110号机将跟随。410号机将在您升空后加入编队。保持300节直到加入。\n2.    然后你们将前往Sukhumi，在那里进行低空通场飞越跑道12并施放烟雾。在第一次通场前保持低于480节。\n3.    完成后，您将跟随航点前往另一个低空通场，在Senaki跑道27再次施放烟雾。\n4.    然后您将飞出黑海上空，并爬升到高度20000英尺跟随航点。当您再次抵达海岸上空时，您将为第一次加油与\"Texaco\"建立联系。\n5.    一旦你们俩都成功完成加油，您将继续沿航线飞行。\n6.    您的后续旅程包括在土耳其的Batman空军基地过夜停留，然后明天一早前往海湾地区。\n\n就是这样，当您下意识地打开大黄蜂的电池开关时，一群直升机从头顶近距离飞过。Axis，一个大黄蜂小组正准备离开去执行高加索地区的最后任务，甲板上如往常一样繁忙嘈杂。幸好，天气很好，天空几乎没有云。您向右看去，\"Wave\" 410向您竖起大拇指，我们要出发了...\n\n要完成此任务，您需要能够白天从Stennis起飞/能够开关烟雾/接收并使用Tacan定位Texaco/使用无线电联系Texaco/在右舷与Texaco进行空中加油，同时\"Wave\"在左舷加油。\n\n通讯\n\nTexaco : 3150.00  主频道1 / Tacan 10X    \n\n提示\n\n1.    确保您设置了控制来激活和停用烟雾。\n2.    激活Data Link和SA页面。\n3.    \"Wave\" 410预定首先起飞，并将在起落航线中等待，直到您升空后加入。\n4.    记住您是长机，与僚机飞行，给他时间加入您，他可能从之前的等待轨道追赶上来。保持300节巡航直到加入。然后在整个任务中适当控制您的速度，考虑到他。\n5.    联合加油：确保您使用右舷加油吊舱与Texaco加油。\"Wave\"将使用左舷，无论您是否在场。使用您僚机的进近作为正确加油机进近速度的指导。如果您到达加油机时领先僚机太远，并且他左舷的加油吊舱尚未伸出，那么等待，直到它伸出后再进行您的\"准备预接触\"无线电呼叫。这将正确激活您右舷的加油吊舱。\n6.    确保您设置了控制，以便根据需要轻松开关烟雾。\n\n笔记\n\n1.    每个任务都有一个膝板，包含所有必要信息。调用膝板并选择背面页面一次。\n2.    在任务中请求加油机之前，您将无法通过Tacan定位加油机。（这是任务设计，以最小化VR用户的资源。）\n3.    很多通信是基于触发的。飞行员必须操作无线电进行航母进近和空中加油。\n4.    任务设计是基于触发的，因此重要的是您遵循路线和任何指示，以实现所有内容并通过任务。\n5.    保证任务绕过机制可通过F10功能选择，但仅在任务开始的前五分钟内可用。\n\n祝好运，享受！\n\n18",

They all gave their best and wished us well for our new deployment on the Abe. \n\nCAG explained that at last the Stennis Task Force had received orders to leave the area. Consequently, the Admiral had agreed with the Georgian Authorities, as a parting gesture, that he would arrange for a fly past. This would be with red and white smoke in recognition of the Georgian Flag.

  "THIS VERSION ADDS AN ADDITION MIG21\n\n1.    Dodge Group, (Two Hornets), will head to an anchor point North East of Khasab.\n2.    The rescue Helo, Lifter, will be holding off the coast of Seerik clear of the SAM range.\n3.    Ford Group will make a standard egress, and when clear, climb to Angels 4 for WP 1.\n4.    Ford Group will then push to WP 2 at Angels 19 and  established in an orbit there BEFORE TIME 1 6.\n5.    AT TIME 1 6 Dodge Group will declare Code word \"CLEAR VIEW\". They will then commence a SEAD attack to take out the SA11 site that brought down Cutlass.\n6.    When the SA11 site is down, Dodge Group will declare Code word \"TOUCH DOWN\". Ford Group to then commence a push to Seerik, contact Cutlass, and the area for Lifter. \n7.    When all is clear for Lifter to approach Ford Group will declare Code word, \"ATLAS\". Lifter will then leave its anchor point over the sea and commence inland for the rescue of 'Cutlass'. \n8.    Ford Group to remain on site giving CAS until Lifter has made pick up and clear of area.\n9.    R.T.B. \n \nAs Dodge Group disappear, ripping their way through the silky blue sky, you run up your Hornets performing all the checks as fast as you can. You need to be anchored on station within 16 minutes. Today, time is of the essence . . .  that is, if you are going to save one of your own.  \n\nTo complete this mission, you will need to be able to launch from the ABE by Day with good visibility /\nOperate Radar including GMT mode, Data Link and SA page / Operate TGP / Use all weapons on board / Use radio to communicate with ABE / Use Tacan to locate ABE / Carry out Case 1 approach and landing. \n\nCOMMS\n\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 Pri Channel 1  / Tacan 72X / ICSL Channel 11\n\nTIPS\n\n1.    Use the 'Std Heading' procedure to save time configuring the INS.\n2.    Make sure you activate your data link and SA page for better situational awareness. Know how to use the SA page to relocate your wingman in case you need to follow him.\n3.    Remember, when flying with your wingman, give him time to join you, he could well be catching up from a previous holding orbit. So, CONTROL YOUR SPEED APPROPRIATELY THROUGHOUT THE MISSION.\n4.    Put your TGP on standby, you never know when you might need it.\n5.    You need to be at your anchor point within 16 minutes. You can judge this with your clock and the H.S.I. Time to go data.\n6.    Be patient when at your anchor point to allow time for the AGM88C missiles to reach their destination and take out the SA11. Use the time to ensure your TGP and AGM65F's are all setup ready to go.\n7.    Ensure you are on point with your gun runs, remember time will be of the essence to get Cutlass out safely.\n8.    Some of the USS Abraham Lincoln's accompanying ships have been laid out to describe the four points of the 5-mile circle adjacent the ABE, which forms the basis of the Case 1 landing procedures. These can be used visually to fly an accurate 5-mile circle\n\nNOTES\n\n1.    Each mission has a kneeboard containing all essential information.\n2.    A lot of the communications are trigger based. Pilots will have to operate the radio for Carrier approaches and aerial refueling.\n3.    The design of the missions are trigger based and so it is important that you follow the route and any instructions to realise all the content and pass the mission.\n4.

  "1.    Take off from Khasab and head WP 1 at Angels 6\n2.    Head to WP 2 at Angels 15.\n3.    Contact Trojan, locate using radar, Relieve Uzi, and escort Trojan until safely landed at Fujairah. JOIN FORMATION FROM THE REAR AT 300KTS.\n4.    R.T.B. ABE Case 3.\n\nIt has been a long day, but as you settle back into the cockpit for the second time, you admire the evening sun on the mountains ahead. You are looking forward to getting back to the ABE, after all, it's only a simple escort mission. \n\nTo complete this mission, you will need to be able to take off from the Khasab Airport under A.T.C. control by Day with good visibility / Operate Radar, Data Link and SA page / Operate TGP / Use weapons on board / Use radio to communicate with ABE / Use Tacan to locate ABE / Carry out Case 3 approach and landing. \n\nCOMMS\n\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 Pri Channel 1  / Tacan 72X / ICSL Channel 11\n\nTIPS\n\n1.    Use the 'Std Heading' procedure TO SAVE TIME CONFIGURING THE INS.\n2.    Make sure you activate your data link and SA page for better situational awareness.\n3.    After start up at Khasab you need to contact ATC via F10 menu to confirm ready to taxi.\n4.    DO NOT RESPOND TO AUTOMATED DCS RADIO MENU FROM KHASAB WHEN COMMENCING TAXI AS ALL RADIO MESSAGES HERE ARE TRIGGER BASED.  \n5.    Remember when flying with your wingman, give him time to join you, he could well be catching up from a previous holding orbit. So, CONTROL YOUR SPEED APPROPRIATELY THROUGHOUT THE MISSION.\n6.    Put your TGP on standby, you never know when you might need it.\n7.    Ensure your weapons are kept in readiness both air to air and air to ground. If you are escorting you need to be ready.\n8.    Best way to locate Case 3 stack behind the ABE is to use Tacan and enter ships course to give line and distance. \n9.    As part of the Case 3 procedure, you will be given a time to commence your approach from the hold. If you decide to commence before this time, to save time, you will still be able to pass this mission. Strict compliance of the commencement time is not a Mission success criterion.\n\nNOTES\n\n1.    Each mission has a kneeboard containing all essential information.\n2.    A lot of the communications are trigger based. Pilots will have to operate the radio for the Case 3 Carrier approach.\n3.    You will not be able to locate 'Trojan' via your radar until they have made contact. (This by mission design to minimise resources for VR users).\n4.    The design of the missions are trigger based and so it is important that you follow the route and any instructions to realise all the content and pass the mission.\n5.    THE GUARANTEED MISSION BYPASS MECHANISM IS AVAILABLE FOR SELECTION THROUGH THE F10 FUNCTION BUT ONLY FOR THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES OF A MISSION COMMENCING.\n\n\n\nGood luck, Enjoy!\n\n13\n\n" : "1.    从Khasab起飞，前往航点1，高度Angels 6。\n2.    前往航点2，高度Angels 15。\n3.    联系Trojan，使用雷达定位，接替Uzi，并护送Trojan直到安全降落在Fujairah。以300节速度从后方加入编队。\n4.    返回基地ABE，Case 3。\n\n这是漫长的一天，但当你第二次坐回驾驶舱时，你欣赏着前方山上的夕阳。你期待着返回ABE，毕竟这只是一个简单的护送任务。\n\n要完成此任务，你需要能够在白天良好能见度下在A.T.C.控制下从Khasab机场起飞 / 操作雷达、数据链和SA页面 / 操作TGP / 使用机载武器 / 使用无线电与ABE通信 / 使用Tacan定位ABE / 执行Case 3进近和降落。\n\n通讯\n\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 Pri Channel 1  / Tacan 72X / ICSL Channel 11\n\n提示\n\n1.    使用'Std Heading'程序以节省配置INS的时间。\n2.    确保激活数据链和SA页面以获得更好的态势感知。\n3.    在Khasab启动后，你需要通过F10菜单联系ATC以确认准备好滑行。\n4.    开始滑行时不要响应来自KHASAB的自动化DCS无线电菜单，因为这里所有无线电消息都是基于触发的。\n5.    记住与你的僚机飞行时，给他时间加入你，他很可能从之前的等待轨道赶上来。因此，在整个任务中适当控制你的速度。\n6.    将你的TGP置于待命状态，你永远不知道何时可能需要它。\n7.    确保你的武器保持就绪状态，包括空对空和空对地。如果你是护航，需要做好准备。\n8.    定位ABE后方Case 3堆栈的最佳方法是使用Tacan并输入船只航向以提供线和距离。\n9.    作为Case 3程序的一部分，你将获得一个从等待开始进近的时间。如果你决定提前开始以节省时间，你仍然能够通过此任务。严格遵守开始时间不是任务成功的标准。\n\n注释\n\n1.    每个任务都有一个膝板包含所有基本信息。\n2.    许多通讯是基于触发的。飞行员将必须操作无线电进行Case 3航母进近。\n3.    在'Trojan'联系之前，你将无法通过雷达定位他们。（这是任务设计，以最小化VR用户的资源使用）。\n4.    任务设计是基于触发的，因此遵循路线和任何指令以实现所有内容并通过任务非常重要。\n5.    保证任务绕过机制可通过F10功能选择，但仅在任务开始的前五分钟内可用。\n\n祝你好运，玩得开心！\n13",

At least the Task Force had forward assets at the airport and so there had been no problem getting the aircraft refuelled and re-armed. \n\nAs we climbed out of our aircraft, we were directed to an adjacent building, in which we were given a full briefing by military personal based there. It turns out Central Command is bringing in a new Admiral to take charge of operations in the Gulf. He is arriving today, in a C-17A \"Trojan\", approaching from the West and soon to arrive routing over Dubai and landing in Fujairah. They are a high value target and so are currently being escorted by two Hornets, Uzi Group. Our mission is to meet them as they arrive on the west coast and take over the escort from Uzi, until Trojan lands in Fujairah.\n\n\n" : "根据要求，此版本不再强制执行湍流效果，如果您希望，可以在自己的设置中选择它。\n\n幸运的是，Lifter 按计划将 Cutlass 带回了安全区域，并且在此过程中摧毁了几架伊朗飞机和直升机；按任何人的标准，这都是一个彻底的成功。\n\n我们没有预料到会转场到 Khasab 机场，但我们知道指挥部会有“锦囊妙计”。至少特遣部队在机场有前沿资产，因此飞机加油和重新武装没有问题。\n\n当我们爬出飞机时，我们被指引到相邻的建筑物，那里的军事人员为我们做了完整的简报。原来中央指挥部正在调派一名新海军上将负责海湾地区的行动。他今天抵达，乘坐一架 C-17A \"Trojan\"，从西方接近，很快将经过 Dubai 并降落在 Fujairah。他们是一个高价值目标，因此目前由两架大黄蜂，Uzi 小组护航。我们的任务是在他们抵达西海岸时与他们会合，并从 Uzi 手中接管护航，直到 Trojan 降落在 Fujairah。",

Angels 4. Caution possible AAA once over land.\n4.    Commence target run in. WP5 is approximate target position. YOU WILL NEED TO LOCATE TARGET'S EXACT POSITION USING TGP and destroy with GBU38's. Caution AAA expected here. (See target image)\n5.    Egress area to WP6 Angels 4.\n6.    Egress to WP7 climbing to Angels 15.

THERE ARE NO TANKERS AIRBORNE.\n\nLifter is on the bow of the ABE awaiting clearance to leave. As you both bring your Hornets into life you note that the low overcast cloud seems to be casting a strange light. Neither of you are looking forward to this mission. It could turn into a shooting alley with you two as the ducks. \n\nTo complete this mission, you will need to be able to launch from the ABE by day, overcast with rain, visibility reasonable / Operate Radar, Data Link and SA page / Operate TGP / Use weapons on board / Use radio to communicate with ABE / Use Tacan to locate ABE / Carry out Case 1 approach and landing with low overcast skies and rain. \n\nCOMMS\n\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 Pri Channel 2  / Tacan 72X / ICSL Channel 11\n\nTIPS\n\n1.    Change your predicted position constantly if under AAA fire\n2.    Use the 'Std Heading' procedure TO SAVE TIME CONFIGURING THE INS.\n3.    Make sure you activate your data link and SA page for better situational awareness.\n4.    Remember when flying with your wingman, give him time to join you, he could well be catching up from a previous holding orbit. So, CONTROL YOUR SPEED APPROPRIATELY THROUGHOUT THE MISSION.\n5.    Put your TGP on standby, you never know when you might need it.\n6.    Remember to initiate weapons and TGP well ahead of time required. Step through the GBU-38's and set to TOO mode prior to attack so all that you have to do during attack is locate target with TGP and designate. \n7.    There are no tankers airborne so you will have to watch your fuel. Only push it when you must. \n8.    When taking out the SA6 there will be a lot of radiation sources to select from. Line up on way point 8 and as you approach the SA6 it will become a bigger threat and will drop to the inner circle of your EW display. This is the time to select it to be sure you have selected the correct source.\n9.    Some of the USS Abraham Lincoln's accompanying ships have been laid out to describe the four points of the 5-mile circle adjacent the ABE which forms the basis of the Case 1 landing procedures. These can be used visually to fly an accurate 5-mile circle. They will be difficult to see this time with the overcast cloud and rain. Use your Tacan / HSI and course line to keep orientated.\n\nNOTES\n\n1.    Each mission has a kneeboard containing all essential information.\n2.    A lot of the communications are trigger based. Pilots will have to operate the radio for Carrier approaches and aerial refueling.\n3.    The design of the missions are trigger based and so it is important that you follow the route and any instructions to realise all the content and pass the mission.\n4.

  "AS REQUESTED, THIS VERSION NO LONGER ENFORCES TURBULENCE, SELECT IT IF YOU WISH IN YOUR OWN SETTINGS.\n\nAfter your exploits over Fujairah, turns out Admiral Victor Carl Campbell was very appreciative, both you and Matrix hoped it would put Ford Group in pole position on his 'special favour list'. \n\n\nOn an international strategic front, concern has been growing about not just the current shipping conflict in the Straits, but also the threat of Iran becoming a nuclear power. The new Admiral, a known hard liner, had been brought in to take a much tougher stance. His brief is to crush the current problems posed by the I.R.G.C. led by Asad, and to remove the nuclear threat. His strategy is to carry out a series of big hit strikes which will hurt and discourage Iran from pursuing its current course. He calls it his \"Four Point Strike Plan\".\n\n\nYou both attend a high-level briefing which, to your surprise, was also attended by the Admiral himself. As the briefing started to unfold, it slowly dawned on you, that your exploits at Fujairah Airport protecting the Admiral may not have had the desired effect. Rather than securing preferential treatment for Ford Group, as you first hoped, the Admiral clearly saw Ford Group as an effective team, and so, wanted you as a key player in his \"Four Point Strike Plan\".\n\n\n\nFord Group are to embark on the first 'Point' of the Admirals plan. Near Minab there is a Hydroelectric Dam. Intel have learnt that there is a processing plant at its base where it is thought they are manufacturing parts related to their nuclear programme. Ford Group's mission is to take the processing plant out, and as a bonus this will also disable their power supply for the area. \n\nUnusually, the weather is poor with an overcast cloud base at 4,600 feet. The operation is not to be cancelled though, as it is thought with the current conditions such an attack would not be expected. A low-level route has been planned to avoid the current SAM threats. There could be A.A.A. in the area especially around the Dam. Once the drop has been made and surprise lost, you will climb above the cloud base and route back to the ABE via the carefully planned designated route. On the return journey you will break through the SAM wall down the Iran coast, taking out the designated SA6 site. This, to clear a low-level path for a covert Special Forces Helo Operation later tonight. \n\n\n\n" : "应要求，此版本不再强制开启湍流效果，如需此效果请在自行设置中勾选。\n\n在富查伊拉的行动之后，维克多·卡尔·坎贝尔海军上将非常赞赏，你与马特里斯都希望这能让福特组在他那份‘特别关照名单’上占据有利位置。\n\n在国际战略层面，令人担忧的不仅是当前霍尔木兹海峡的航运冲突，还有伊朗成为核国家的威胁。新任海军上将，一位众所周知的强硬派，已被调任来采取更严厉的立场。他的任务是粉碎由阿萨德领导的伊朗革命卫队造成的当前问题，并消除核威胁。他的策略是执行一系列重大打击行动，以重创并阻止伊朗继续其当前路线。他称之为他的“四点打击计划”。\n\n你们都参加了一次高级别简报会，令你们惊讶的是，上将本人也出席了。随着简报会逐渐展开，你们慢慢意识到，你们在富查伊拉机场保护上将的行动可能并未产生预期效果。上将显然将福特组视为一支高效的团队，因此希望你们成为他“四点打击计划”中的关键力量，而非如你们最初所希望的那样为福特组争取到优待。\n\n福特组将执行上将计划中的第一个‘要点’。米纳布附近有一座水电站大坝。情报显示其底部有一座加工厂，据信正在生产与其核计划相关的部件。福特组的任务是摧毁该加工厂，作为额外收获，这还将切断该地区的电力供应。\n\n天气异常恶劣，云底高4600英尺，阴云密布。但行动不会被取消，因为据信在当前条件下，这样的攻击不会被预料到。已规划一条低空航线以避开当前的防空导弹威胁。该区域可能有防空炮，尤其是在大坝周围。一旦投弹完成并丧失突然性，你们将爬升至云层之上，沿精心规划的指定路线返回ABE。在返航途中，你们将突破伊朗海岸线的防空导弹墙，摧毁指定的SA6阵地。此举是为今晚稍后的特种部队直升机隐蔽行动开辟一条低空通道。",

  "\n1.    Std straight ahead night-time departure from the ABE. Maintain straight ahead until radio call. Once clear head WP1 at Angels 20.\n2.    Head WP2 angels 20. On route contact Texaco and plug for 'top off'. Then at WP2 you are to orbit whilst Blade group Helos get into position. (YOU MUST 'TOP OFF' WITH TEXACO, MISSION SUCCESS REQUIREMENT).\n3.    When Strike declares Code word 'Brush Down' Ford Group to commence SEAD and take out the two SA6 sites on Abu Musa WP3 (GENERAL LOCATION OF ISLAND, NOT TARGET COORDINATES).\n4.    Strike will declare Code word \"Clean Sweep\" when SAMs are down. Blade 1 and 2 will then push to rigs. Ford Group to give CAS cover over the rigs WP 4&5 whilst Blade Group are over rigs. (TARGET RIGS WILL NOT BE ILLUMINATED).\n5.    When rigs are destroyed, and Code word \"Clear Deck\" given, head WP6 Angels 12. Contact Arco for plug prior to R.T.B. (YOU MUST PLUG WITH ARCO. MISSION REQUIREMENT.) \n\n\"At least the moon is out\", Matrix shouts over as he settles down into his pit. You give him the 'thumbs up'. Tiger Group are on their CAT's and launching off to their own separate mission. As you start to think of the mission ahead your thoughts turn to the Special Forces that are about to drop out of Helos onto the rigs not knowing what they will come up against. At least you can stay aboard your bird until the mission is over, well, that is if everything goes as planned. \n\nTo complete this mission, you will need to be able to: Launch from the ABE in good conditions at night Case 3/ Use weapons in your loadout / Use your targeting pod / Use Tacan to locate Texaco, Arco and ABE / Use radar, SA page, data Link / Use radio to contact Texaco, Arco and ABE / carry out A2A refuel at night / Use NVG's / Carry out Case 3 approach and landing on ABE at night.\n\nCOMMS\n\nTexaco : 360.00 Pri Channel 2 / Tacan 10X\nArco : 352.00 Pri Channel 3 / Tacan 12X\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 Pri Channel 4 / Tacan 72X / ICSL Channel 11\n\nTIPS\n\n1.    You will need to use the Night Vision Goggles for refuel. ENSURE YOU REQUEST THEY ARE FITTED BY THE GROUND CREW BEFORE YOU FLY. Otherwise, you will not be able to use them when airborne.\n2.    Use the 'Std Heading' procedure TO SAVE TIME CONFIGURING THE INS.\n3.    Watch your fuel.\n4.    Make sure you activate your data link and SA page for better situational awareness.\n5.    Remember when flying with your wingman, give him time to join you, he could well be catching up from a previous holding orbit. So, CONTROL YOUR SPEED APPROPRIATELY THROUGHOUT THE MISSION.\n6.    When striking the two SA6 sites on the island you will note a third reading on your EW. This is a SA6 on the island behind. As you approach the correct two targets will jump to the inner ring of the EW.    \n7.    Joint Refuel: YOU MUST TOP OFF WITH TEXACO AND PLUG WITH ARCO THEY ARE MISSION REQUIREMENTS. (You do not need to fully fill your tanks, that is your call). Ensure you refuel with tanker using the starboard basket. \"Matrix\" will use the Port side whether you are there or not. Use your wingman's approach as a guide to the correct tanker approach speed. IF YOU ARRIVE AT THE TANKER TOO FAR AHEAD OF YOUR WINGMAN, AND HIS FUEL BASKET ON THE TANKERS PORT SIDE IS NOT ALREADY EXTENDED THEN WAIT, DO NOT MAKE YOUR \"READY PRECONTACT\" RADIO CALL UNTIL IT IS. THIS WILL THEN CORRECTLY ACTIVATE YOUR REFUEL BASKET ON THE STARBOARD SIDE.  wait until both of you are refueled and then CONFIRM VIA F10 MENU EACH TIME.\n8.    When making a Case 3 approach best to use Tacan and enter ships course to give line and distance to locate hold position.\n9.    As part of the Case 3 procedure, you will be given a time to commence your approach from the hold. If you decide to commence before this time, to save time, you will still be able to pass this mission. Strict compliance of the commencement time is not a Mission success criterion.\n10.    Ensure you respond to requests to confirm instructions using the F10 Menu. \n\nNOTES\n\n1.    Each mission has a kneeboard containing all essential information.\n2.    You will not be able to locate tankers via Tacan until they have been requested in the mission.      (This by mission design to minimise resources for VR users). \n3.    A lot of the communications are trigger based. Pilots will have to operate the radio for Carrier approaches and aerial refueling.\n4.    The design of the missions are trigger based and so it is important that you follow the route and any instructions to realise all the content and pass the mission.\n5.

These two rigs are located 8 miles East of the Iranian held island of Abu Musa. They are at the centre of a nest of other rigs. Their yield is so high and the Iranians so protective of them that they are not illuminated at night.  This night mission will require Ford Group to firstly provide a SEAD role taking out the two SA6's on the island.

Iranian eyes are on the I.R.G.C. who are both furious and embarrassed that they were unable to prevent this and the previous Task Force strikes. \n\nThe Admiral's Strike Plan strategy to undermine Iranian confidence in the I.R.G.C.is working as its authority within the Country is clearly waning. As a result, he calculated the I.R.G.C. would lose power and in turn also its present leader, Asad.\n\nThe Iranian sinkers, which you and 'Wave' both sighted when you first arrived, are becoming a bigger risk to the Task Force as Asad's options are narrowing. Point three of the Admiral's plan is to remove these assets. To this end, constant aerial patrols are being organised, to find and destroy them on sight. You and Matrix are about to start on one such 'search and destroy' patrol. Dodge, Colt and Chevy Groups are also tasked, and each have their own search area.\n\n\n" : "按需求，此版本不再强制开启湍流效果，若需此功能请在个人设置中自行选择。\n\n此版本已添加额外米格战机。\n\nStrike two，对伊朗两座高产油井平台的有效摧毁在全国范围内引发震动。伊朗的目光聚焦于伊斯兰革命卫队，他们既愤怒又难堪，因未能阻止此次及先前特遣部队的袭击。\n\n上将打击计划中旨在削弱伊朗对伊斯兰革命卫队信心的策略正在奏效，其在国内的权威显然在减弱。因此，他预判伊斯兰革命卫队将失势，连带其现任领导人阿萨德也将下台。\n\n你与'Wave'初抵时发现的伊朗沉没式钻井平台，随着阿萨德的选择日益减少，正对特遣部队构成更大威胁。上将计划的第三点便是清除这些资产。为此，已组织持续空中巡逻，旨在发现并即刻摧毁它们。你与Matrix即将开始执行一次此类“搜索摧毁”巡逻。Dodge、Colt和Chevy编队同样受命执行此任务，各自负责专属搜索区域。",

  "THIS VERSION HAS ADDITIONAL MIG ADDED\n\n1.    Standard Case 1 departure straight ahead 500feet, maintain heading until radio call, when clear, head WP1 at Angels 15. (Matrix, 420 will be first to launch and will join you when you are airborne)\n2.    Patrol between WP1 and WP2 for sighting of sinkers. If sighted contact Strike for orders.\n3.    R.T.B. \n\nIt is a beautiful morning, and the sun has just lifted above the horizon, casting golden rays down the deck. As usual the deck is a hive of activity as a group of four attack Helos pass overhead. Dodge and Chevy groups are already at the Cat's, ready for launch, eager to commence their search patrols. Colt group are just about to taxi as you and Matrix run up your Hornets. You sense there is more than a little competition, to be the first flight to engage the sinkers.\n\nTo complete this mission, you will need to be able to launch from the ABE by Day with good visibility Case 1/ Operate Radar (including sea mode), Data Link and SA page / Operate TGP / Use weapons on board / Use radio to communicate with ABE / Use Tacan to locate ABE / Carry out Case 1 approach and landing.\n\nCOMMS\n\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 Pri Channel 2 / Tacan 72X / ICSL Channel 11\n\nTIPS\n\n1.    Use the 'Std Heading' procedure TO SAVE TIME CONFIGURING THE INS.\n2.    Make sure you activate your data link and SA page for better situational awareness.\n3.    Put your TGP on standby, you never know when you might need it.\n4.    Coordinates used in this mission are not 'Precise' coordinates. \n5.    Watch your fuel there are no tankers up.\n6.    Remember when flying with your wingman, give him time to join you, he could well be catching up from a previous holding orbit. So, CONTROL YOUR SPEED APPROPRIATELY THROUGHOUT THE MISSION.\n7.    Be familiar with the 'switchology' of using the Harpoon with the Sea Radar, also the TGP as any target must be visually identified before engaging and confirmed back to Strike using the F10 menu. SUGGEST USING THE HARPOON 'POP UP' TERMINAL SETTING, WITH THE 'SKIM' SETTING THE MISSILE CAN PASS STRAIGHT OVER THE 'SINKER' IF IT MISSES THE TOWER.\n8.    Ensure you respond to requests to confirm instructions using the F10 Menu. \n9.    Some of the USS Abraham Lincoln's accompanying ships have been laid out to describe the four points of the 5-mile circle adjacent the ABE which forms the basis of the Case 1 landing procedures. These can be used visually to fly an accurate 5-mile circle\n\nNOTES\n\n1.    Each mission has a kneeboard containing all essential information.\n2.    Other than missions 1 and 2 all missions are cold start. Remember to ask ground crew to remove the chocks.\n3.    The design of the missions are trigger based and so it is important that you follow the route and any instructions to realise all the content and pass the mission.\n4.    THE GUARANTEED MISSION BYPASS MECHANISM IS AVAILABLE FOR SELECTION THROUGH THE F10 FUNCTION BUT ONLY FOR THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES OF A MISSION COMMENCING.\n\n\nGood luck, Enjoy!\n\n\n21" : "此版本添加了额外的MIG\n\n1.    标准Case 1离场，直飞500英尺，保持航向直到无线电呼叫，当清空后，前往WP1，高度Angels 15。（Matrix，420将首先起飞，并在你升空后加入你）\n2.    在WP1和WP2之间巡逻，搜索沉船。如果发现，联系Strike获取指令。\n3.    返回基地。\n\n这是一个美丽的早晨，太阳刚刚升出地平线，将金色光芒洒在甲板上。像往常一样，甲板上忙碌非凡，四架攻击直升机从头顶飞过。Dodge和Chevy小组已经在弹射器上，准备起飞，急切地开始他们的搜索巡逻。Colt小组正要滑行，当你和Matrix启动你们的黄蜂战机时。你感觉到有一场不小的竞争，要成为第一个与沉船交战的小队。\n\n要完成这个任务，你需要能够在白天从ABE起飞，能见度良好Case 1/操作雷达（包括海面模式）、数据链和SA页面/操作TGP/使用机载武器/使用无线电与ABE通信/使用Tacan定位ABE/执行Case 1进近和着陆。\n\n通讯\n\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 主频道 2 / Tacan 72X / ICSL 频道 11\n\n提示\n\n1.    使用'Std Heading'程序以节省配置INS的时间。\n2.    确保激活数据链和SA页面以获得更好的态势感知。\n3.    将TGP置于待命状态，你永远不知道什么时候可能需要它。\n4.    本任务中使用的坐标不是'精确'坐标。\n5.    注意燃油，没有加油机可用。\n6.    记住与僚机飞行时，给他时间加入你，他可能从之前的等待轨道赶上来。因此，在整个任务中适当控制你的速度。\n7.    熟悉使用海雷达的'开关学'来操作鱼叉，以及TGP，因为任何目标在交战前必须视觉识别，并使用F10菜单向Strike确认。建议使用鱼叉的'弹起'终端设置，使用'掠海'设置，如果导弹错过塔楼，可能会直接飞过'沉船'。\n8.    确保使用F10菜单响应请求以确认指令。\n9.    一些USS Abraham Lincoln的伴随舰船已被布置来描述邻近ABE的5英里圆的四个点，这构成了Case 1着陆程序的基础。这些可以视觉上用于飞行准确的5英里圆。\n\n注释\n\n1.    每个任务都有一个膝板，包含所有重要信息。\n2.    除了任务1和2，所有任务都是冷启动。记得要求地勤人员移除轮挡。\n3.    任务的设计是基于触发器的，因此遵循路线和任何指令以实现所有内容并通过任务非常重要。\n4.    保证任务绕过机制可通过F10功能选择，但仅在任务开始的前五分钟内可用。\n\n祝你好运，玩得开心！\n\n21",

  "\n1.    Uzi Group and Dodge Group will launch and route to their anchor points.\n2.    Ford Group to make Case 3 Standard departure and when 7 miles clear (you will get radio message), head to WP1 at Angels 05\n3.    Then route to WP2 and anchor there at Angels 05.\n4.    At time 4 5 Strike will declare Code word \"MAIN EVENT\". Arleigh Burke to commence launch of 12 cruise missiles, all targeted on the SAM sites around Bandar Abbas.\n5.    Strike will declare Code word \"DARK SKY\" when SAMs down. Dodge and Uzi groups will then commence engaging aircraft on the ground in Bandar Abbas area with AGM-84 Echoes.\n6.    When all Iranian aircraft on the ground destroyed Strike will declare code word \"CLEAR VIEW\". Ford Group to then start push via WP3 at angels 05 for IP to search and destroy \"Souria\" entering docks. Docks at WP4.\n7.    On destruction of the \"Souria\" Ford Group to then search for location of Blister (the meeting of the scientists and possibly Asad and his I.R.G.C. commanders). Possible locations are WP5,6 & 7. Once located report to Strike for instructions. (THERE WILL BE VEHICLES, BUSES, AND TROOPS EVIDENT IN THE RIGHT LOCATION). \n8.    Egress via WP8,9 & 10 \n9.    Contact Texaco for plug above cloud base at Angel 15 then RTB. (Plug is a successful mission requirement)\n\nIt is the middle of the night, but tonight the deck is full of action as Uzi and Dodge groups are on their CATs ready for launch. As if tonight's mission is not challenging enough, the conditions are going to make it even more so. The combination of overcast clouds at 6,600 feet and no moonlight means it is going to be black as the Abyss up there. Your last words to Matrix are, \"FOR GOD'S SAKE MAKE SURE YOUR GOG'S ARE FULLY FUNCTIONAL, YOUR LIFE WILL DEPEND ON THEM TONIGHT\", \"ROGER THAT ONE\".\n\nTo complete this mission, you will need to be able to: Launch from ABE in overcast conditions at night Case 3/ Use weapons in your loadout / Use your targeting pod / Use Tacan to locate Texaco and ABE / Use radar, SA page, data Link / Use radio to contact Texaco and ABE / carry out A2A refuel / Use NVG's / Carry out Case 3 approach and landing on ABE at night.\n\nCOMMS\n\nTexaco : 325.00 Pri Channel 1 / Tacan 10X\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 Pri Channel 2 / Tacan 72X / ICSL Channel 11\n\nTIPS\n\n1.    You will need to use the Night Vision Goggles. ENSURE YOU REQUEST THEY ARE FITTED BY THE GROUND CREW BEFORE YOU FLY. Otherwise, you will not be able to use them when airborne.\n2.    There is no moonlight below the cloud cover tonight and so at times you will be totally reliant on your instruments.\n3.    Use the 'Std Heading' procedure TO SAVE TIME CONFIGURING THE INS.\n4.    Watch your fuel.\n5.    Make sure you activate your data link and SA page for better situational awareness.\n6.    Remember when flying with your wingman, give him time to join you, he could well be catching up from a previous holding orbit. So, CONTROL YOUR SPEED APPROPRIATELY THROUGHOUT THE MISSION.\n7.    When established at your anchor point, (WP2), before time 4 5 you will need some patience. It will take time for both the cruise and AGM-84 Echo missile attacks to cover the 30 miles to Bandar Abbas. Also keep to your designated height of Angels 05 to avoid conflict with the other flights some of which may pass over you. As it is not possible to use your GOGs and see your instruments at the same time you can locate your anchor point with the HSI and then monitor it visually with your GOGs by noting your position and distance from the Khasab peninsular.\n8.    Ensure you set up your weapons well ahead and step through your bombs ensuring you have set each for TOO so you just have to designate the target with the TGP during your attack. \n9.    When searching for 'BLISTER' use your TGP and FLIR. Look for Coaches, vehicles, and soldiers as this will give away its location. You will need to confirm correct location to Strike via the F10 function and await signal. NOTE, INCORRECT IDENTIFICATION WOULD MEAN CIVILIANS WILL BE KILLED AND IS AN INSTANT MISSION FAIL.  \n10.    Caution over Bandar Abbas as AAA is expected. If under fire, ensure you keep changing your anticipated vector.\n11.    Joint Refuel: YOU MUST PLUG WITH TEXACO PRIOR TO RTB. IT IS A MISSION REQUIREMENT. (You do not need to fully fill your tanks, that is your call). Ensure you refuel with tanker using the starboard basket. \"Matrix\" will use the Port side whether you are there or not. Use your wingman's approach as a guide to the correct tanker approach speed. IF YOU ARRIVE AT THE TANKER TOO FAR AHEAD OF YOUR WINGMAN, AND HIS FUEL BASKET ON THE TANKERS PORT SIDE IS NOT ALREADY EXTENDED THEN WAIT, DO NOT MAKE YOUR \"READY PRECONTACT\" RADIO CALL UNTIL IT IS. THIS WILL THEN CORRECTLY ACTIVATE YOUR REFUEL BASKET ON THE STARBOARD SIDE.  wait until both of you are refueled and then CONFIRM VIA F10 MENU EACH TIME.\n12.    When leaving Texaco and heading back to the ABE suggest maintaining above cloud until overhead stack position to ensure you miss the mountains.\n13.    Use the Tacan and course given to you by the ABE to locate the Case 3 stack area 21 miles behind. \n14.    As part of the Case 3 procedure, you will be given a time to commence your approach from the hold. If you decide to commence before this time, to save time, you will still be able to pass this mission. Strict compliance of the commencement time is not a Mission success criterion.\n\nNOTES\n\n1.    Each mission has a kneeboard containing all essential information.\n2.    A lot of the communications are trigger based. Pilots will have to operate the radio for Carrier approaches and aerial refueling.\n3.    You will not be able to locate tankers via Tacan until they have been requested in the mission.      (This by mission design to minimise resources for VR users).\n4.    The design of the missions are trigger based and so it is important that you follow the route and any instructions to realise all the content and pass the mission.\n5.    THE GUARANTEED MISSION BYPASS MECHANISM IS AVAILABLE FOR SELECTION THROUGH THE F10 FUNCTION BUT ONLY FOR THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES OF A MISSION COMMENCING.\n\n\nGood luck, Enjoy!\n  \n19" : "1. Uzi编队和Dodge编队将起飞并前往其锚点。\n2. Ford编队执行Case 3标准离场程序，当距离航母7英里后（你会收到无线电消息），前往航路点1，高度层05。\n3. 然后前往航路点2，并在该处锚定，高度层05。\n4. 在时间4 5，Strike将宣布代码\"MAIN EVENT\"。阿利·伯克号将开始发射12枚巡航导弹，全部瞄准阿巴斯港周围的防空导弹阵地。\n5. 当防空导弹被摧毁后，Strike将宣布代码\"DARK SKY\"。随后，Dodge和Uzi编队将开始用AGM-84E导弹攻击阿巴斯港地区的地面飞机。\n6. 当地面所有伊朗飞机被摧毁后，Strike将宣布代码\"CLEAR VIEW\"。随后，Ford编队开始经由航路点3前推，高度层05，前往起始点搜索并摧毁正在进港的\"Souria\"号。船坞位于航路点4。\n7. 在\"Souria\"号被摧毁后，Ford编队随后搜索\"Blister\"的位置（科学家以及可能包括阿萨德及其伊斯兰革命卫队指挥官的会面地点）。可能的位置是航路点5、6和7。一旦定位，向Strike报告并等待指示。（正确的位置会有明显的车辆、巴士和部队）。\n8. 经由航路点8、9和10退出。\n9. 在云底以上高度层15联系Texaco进行空中加油，然后返回基地。（成功进行空中加油是任务要求）\n\n现在是午夜，但今晚甲板上充满了行动，Uzi和Dodge编队在弹射器上准备起飞。如果说今晚的任务还不够有挑战性的话，天气条件会让它更具挑战。6600英尺的阴云加上没有月光，意味着上空将如同深渊般漆黑。你对Matrix说的最后一句话是，\"看在上帝的份上，确保你的夜视镜功能正常，今晚你的命就靠它们了\"，\"收到\"。\n\n要完成此任务，你需要能够：在夜间阴云条件下从ABE执行Case 3起飞 / 使用挂载的武器 / 使用目标指示吊舱 / 使用塔康定位Texaco和ABE / 使用雷达、态势感知页面、数据链 / 使用无线电联系Texaco和ABE / 进行空中加油 / 使用夜视镜 / 在夜间于ABE执行Case 3进场和降落。\n\n通讯\n\nTexaco : 325.00 主要频道 1 / 塔康 10X\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 主要频道 2 / 塔康 72X / ICLS 频道 11\n\n提示\n\n1. 你需要使用夜视镜。确保在飞行前请求地勤人员为你安装。否则，升空后将无法使用。\n2. 今晚云层下没有月光，因此有时你将完全依赖仪表。\n3. 使用'标准航向'程序以节省配置惯性导航系统的时间。\n4. 注意你的燃油。\n5. 确保激活数据链和态势感知页面以获得更好的态势感知。\n6. 记住与僚机编队飞行时，给他时间加入编队，他可能需要从之前的等待航线追上来。因此，在整个任务过程中适当控制你的速度。\n7. 当在你的锚点（航路点2）建立后，在时间4 5之前，你需要一些耐心。巡航导弹和AGM-84E导弹需要时间飞行30英里到达阿巴斯港。同时保持在指定的高度层05，以避免与其他可能从你上方经过的编队冲突。由于无法同时使用夜视镜和查看仪表，你可以用水平位置指示器定位锚点，然后通过记录你相对于Khasab半岛的位置和距离，用夜视镜进行目视监控。\n8. 确保提前设置好你的武器，并逐一检查你的炸弹，确保已全部设置为\"目标自选\"，这样在攻击时你只需要用目标指示吊舱标定目标即可。\n9. 当搜索'BLISTER'时，使用你的目标指示吊舱和前视红外。寻找客车、车辆和士兵，这会暴露其位置。你需要通过F10功能向Strike确认正确位置并等待信号。注意，错误识别意味着平民将被杀害，并立即导致任务失败。\n10. 在阿巴斯港上空需谨慎，预计有防空炮火。如果遭到攻击，确保不断改变你的预期航向。\n11. 联合加油：在返回基地前，你必须与Texaco进行空中加油。这是任务要求。（你不需要加满油箱，这由你决定）。确保使用右侧的加油锥套进行加油。\"Matrix\"将使用左侧，无论你是否在场。以你僚机的进场速度作为接近加油机的正确速度参考。如果你比你的僚机早太多到达加油机，并且加油机左侧的加油锥套还未伸出，请等待，直到它伸出后再进行你的\"准备预接触\"无线电呼叫。这将正确地激活你右侧的加油锥套。等待你们俩都完成加油，然后每次通过F10菜单进行确认。\n12. 当离开Texaco返回ABE时，建议保持在云层以上直到正上空等待位置，以确保避山。\n13. 使用ABE提供的塔康和航向来定位后方21英里处的Case 3等待空域。\n14. 作为Case 3程序的一部分，你会得到一个从等待点开始进场的时间。如果你决定提前开始进场以节省时间，你仍然可以通过任务。严格遵守开始时间不是任务成功的标准。\n\n注释\n\n1. 每个任务都有一个膝板，包含所有基本信息。\n2. 许多通讯是基于触发器触发的。飞行员将不得不操作无线电进行航母进近和空中加油。\n3. 在任务中请求加油机之前，你将无法通过塔康定位它们。（这是任务设计，旨在为VR用户减少资源占用）。\n4. 任务设计是基于触发器的，因此遵循航路和任何指示以实现所有内容并通过任务非常重要。\n5. 任务保障性跳过机制可通过F10功能选择，但仅在任务开始后的前五分钟内可用。\n\n祝你好运，玩得愉快！",

YOU NOW MUST PLUG ON LEFT BASKET UNTIL BUG FIXED.  \n\nAS REQUESTED, THIS VERSION NO LONGER ENFORCES TURBULENCE, SELECT IT IF YOU WISH IN YOUR OWN SETTINGS.\n\nThings appear to be going in the right direction. It could be that the Admiral's reputation is founded. With the recent sinking of the two Iranian sinkers confidence in the I.R.G.C. is now diminishing, together with its power within Iran. The final part of the Admirals Four Point Strike Plan is to deal with the Iranian nuclear threat, which after all, was the 'Genesis' of the severe International sanctions.  \n\n\nIntel have discovered that a shipment of critical nuclear parts are being shipped into a port near Bandar Abbas. The port is close by the Havadarya air strip. It is understood a gathering of Iran's leading nuclear scientists are nearby, ready to inspect the parts once they arrive. The shipment is due tonight on a Syrian ship, the \"Souria\".\n \n\nTonight's mission is a bold one and will involve an Arleigh Burke Destroyer. It will route North of Khasab and launch some twelve cruise missiles. They will target all the SAM sites in the region of the operation. Another two F/A-18C groups will attack the Iranian aircraft on the ground, using standoff weapons. Ford Group will then go in and take out the \"Souria\" as it enters the docks. After this, Ford Group are to locate and destroy the gathering of scientists. It is rumoured Asad himself may be there with key I.R.G.C. leaders. The gathering could be in one of several places, and so, Ford Group will have to check each one. It is a night mission, the weather is once again overcast at 6,600 feet, and to make matters worse, any moonlight is totally obscured by the cloud. It is one dark night.\n\n\n\n" : "由于当前加油bug，你的僚机将不会对接但保持队形。你现在必须对接左侧加油篮直到bug修复。  \n\n根据要求，此版本不再强制湍流效果，如需可在自己的设置中选择。\n\n事情似乎正朝着正确的方向发展。可能是这位海军上将的名声是有根据的。随着最近两艘伊朗沉没舰艇的击沉，对伊朗革命卫队的信心正在减弱，连同其在伊朗国内的影响力。海军上将四点打击计划的最后一部分是应对伊朗核威胁，这毕竟是严重国际制裁的“起源”。  \n\n\n情报部门发现一批关键核部件正被运入班达尔阿巴斯附近的一个港口。该港口靠近哈瓦达里亚机场。据悉，伊朗顶尖核科学家聚集在附近，准备在部件到达后进行检查。这批货物预计今晚由叙利亚船只“苏里亚”号运抵。\n \n\n今晚的任务是一次大胆的行动，将涉及一艘阿利·伯克级驱逐舰。它将路由至Khasab以北并发射约12枚巡航导弹。它们将瞄准行动区域内的所有萨姆站点。另外两个F/A-18C编组将使用防区外武器攻击地面上的伊朗飞机。Ford Group随后将进入并在“苏里亚”号进入码头时将其摧毁。此后，Ford Group需定位并摧毁科学家的聚集地。有传言称Asad本人可能在那里，与关键的伊朗革命卫队领导人一起。聚集地可能在几个地方之一，因此，Ford Group将不得不检查每一个地点。这是一次夜间任务，天气再次在6,600英尺处阴云密布，更糟的是，任何月光都被云层完全遮蔽。这是一个黑暗的夜晚。",

  "\n1.    You will be commencing your trip in the air at 15,000 feet East bound having just left the coast of Quatar. Cruise speed 450knts IAS\n2.    Continue en-route to Al-Bateen Airport where you will both land and refuel. Follow ATC instructions exactly you do not want to give the US Navy a bad name.\n3.    Once airborne again continue en-route to the CVN-72 USS Abraham Lincoln and trap. Case 1 joining stack will be at a height of 2,000 feet.\nAs you look through the HUD it is clear it is a whole different world out there. A shimmering orange globe is just emerging over the dusty horizon. You look to your right; Wave is still with you, the sleek lines of his Hornet illuminated with the deep crimsons of a Middle East morning sunrise \n\nTo complete this mission, you will need to be able to land under Air Traffic Control at Al-Bateen Airport in good conditions / Refuel as instructed on the ground / Take-off from Al-Bateen under Air Traffic Control / Be able to use the Tacan (including set up a course) to locate USS Abraham Lincoln / Use your radio, contact the ABE / Make a Case 1 trap on the USS Abraham Lincoln in good conditions. \n\nCOMMS\n\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 Pri Channel 2  / Tacan 72X / ICSL Channel 11 \n\nTIPS\n\n1.    To pass the mission ensure you respond via the F10 menu when requested.\n2.    As this is an airborne start, set up your controls to suit. Set cruise 450knts IAS\n3.    Remember you are flying lead with your wingman. Always control your speed appropriately throughout the mission with him in mind. After take-off from Al-Bateen reduce your speed to allow him to catch up and join you.   \n4.    You must land at Al-Bateen and refuel to pass the mission. CAUTION YOU WILL BE FACING A BIT OF A CROSS WIND LANDING THERE.\n5.    Suggest selection of radar altitude in the 1,000 feet circuit pattern. The circuit pattern has been setup in the HSI as Way Points 2,3 and 4. \n6.    After landing at Al-Bateen DO NOT STOP ON THE RUNWAY BUT CONTINUE TO THE END AS PER AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL INSTRUCTIONS. (You must exit at the end of the runway where the Marshall vehicle is waiting for you). Your wingman 410 will be following you and will not be able to land if you are stationary on the runway.\n7.    As prescribed Case 1 procedures contact the ABE at 50 miles out. Contact details will be relayed via radio and are also on your kneeboard\n8.    Some of the USS Abraham Lincoln's accompanying ships have been laid out to describe the four points of the 5-mile diameter circle, adjacent the ABE, which forms the basis of the Case 1 landing procedures. These can be used visually to fly an accurate 5-mile circle\n\nNOTES\n\n1.    Each mission has a kneeboard containing all essential information. Call kneeboard and select back page once. \n2.    A lot of the communications are trigger based. Pilots will have to operate the radio for Carrier approaches and aerial refueling.\n3.    The design of the missions are trigger based, and so, it is important that you follow the route and any instructions to realise all of the content and pass the mission.\n4.    THE GUARANTEED MISSION BYPASS MECHANISM IS AVAILABLE FOR SELECTION THROUGH THE F10 FUNCTION BUT ONLY FOR THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES OF A MISSION COMMENCING.\n\n\nGood luck, Enjoy!\n\n16\n\n\n" : "1.    你将在15,000英尺高度向东开始你的旅程，刚刚离开卡塔尔海岸。巡航速度450节指示空速。\n2.    继续飞往阿勒巴廷机场，你将在那里着陆并加油。请严格遵守空中交通管制指令，你不想给美国海军抹黑。\n3.    再次升空后，继续飞往CVN-72 USS Abraham Lincoln并着舰。案例1加入等待编队的高度为2,000英尺。\n当你透过平视显示器看去，很明显外面是一个完全不同的世界。一个闪烁的橙色球体正从尘土飞扬的地平线上缓缓升起。你看向右侧；Wave仍在你的身边，他的大黄蜂战机流畅的线条被中东清晨日出的深红色光芒照亮\n\n要完成此任务，你需要能够：在良好条件下根据空中交通管制在阿勒巴廷机场降落 / 按照指示在地面加油 / 根据空中交通管制从阿勒巴廷机场起飞 / 能够使用塔康（包括设置航线）定位USS Abraham Lincoln / 使用你的无线电，联系ABE / 在良好条件下在USS Abraham Lincoln上完成一次案例1着舰。\n\n通信\n\nUSS Abraham Lincoln： 127.50 主频道 2 / 塔康 72X / ICSL 频道 11\n\n技巧\n\n1.    要完成任务，请确保在被要求时通过F10菜单进行响应。\n2.    由于这是空中开始任务，请设置好你的控制以适应。设置巡航速度450节指示空速。\n3.    记住你是长机，与你的僚机一同飞行。在整个任务中，始终考虑到他，相应地控制你的速度。从阿勒巴廷起飞后，降低你的速度以便他赶上并加入你。\n4.    你必须在阿勒巴廷着陆并加油才能通过任务。注意，你在那里着陆时会遇到一些侧风。\n5.    建议在1,000英尺起落航线中选择雷达高度。起落航线已在水平状态指示器中设置为航路点2、3和4。\n6.    在阿勒巴廷着陆后，不要停在跑道上，而是根据空中交通管制指令继续滑行到跑道尽头。（你必须在跑道尽头滑出，引导车在那里等你）。你的僚机410将跟随你，如果你停在跑道上，他将无法着陆。\n7.    按照规定的案例1程序，在50海里处联系ABE。联系细节将通过无线电传达，也在你的膝板上。\n8.    USS Abraham Lincoln的一些伴随舰船被布置用来标定以ABE为中心、直径5海里的圆圈的四点，该圆圈构成了案例1着舰程序的基础。这些可以目视用来飞出一个精确的5海里圆圈。\n\n备注\n\n1.    每个任务都有一个包含所有必要信息的膝板。调用膝板并向后翻页一次。\n2.    很多通信是基于触发器的。飞行员将需要操作无线电进行航母进场和空中加油。\n3.    任务设计是基于触发器的，因此，遵循路线和所有指令以实现所有内容并通过任务非常重要。\n4.    任务开始后的前五分钟内，可以通过F10功能选择使用有保障的任务跳过机制。\n\n祝你好运，玩得开心！\n\n16\n\n\n",

  "NOTE: IN THIS VERSION THE SA6  HAS BEEN SUBSTITUTED  FOR A SA 11, SO LAUNCH DISTANCE COULD BE 20 MILES\n\n1.    You and \"Wave\", \"Ford Group\", are about to commence your first formal security patrol. Engine start is at 07:00 then move to the designated CAT and Launch heading to WP 1. Keep at 500 feet until clear of ABE's 7-mile zone. (Maintain heading until radio call).   \"Wave\" will launch first and then join you when  airborne\n2.    When instructed head to WP 2 at Angels 15. You will be passing through Fujairah airports control zone.\n3.    Remain at Angels 15 and continue along designated route.\n4.    Patrol from WP's 4 to 7. Your brief is to look for any suspicious naval movements.\n5.    RTB\n\nJust as the Stennis, the deck of the ABE is a noisy, busy place. As you are cleared to start engines, Springfield, a group of four Hornets, are in the CATs ready. They are headed for a similar patrol, but to the West side of the U.A.E. The tanker Arco is also in the launch sequence, they will hold in the West to refuel Springfield, as required. Wave gives you a boyish grin as his canopy closes. It is a great flying day!\n\nTo complete this mission, you will need to be able to: take off from the ABE by day good conditions / Operate your radar and SA Page / use AIM9X A2A missiles if required / Use the TGP for identification / Use radio to contact the ABE for approach and landing / Use Tacan to locate and set course for the ABE / Be familiar with Case 1 approach and Landing.\n\nEnsure you respond to requests to confirm instructions using the F10 Menu.\n\nCOMMS\n\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 Pri Channel 2  / Tacan 72X / ICSL Channel 11\n\n\nTIPS\n\n1.    When starting, use the \"Std Heading\" button on your HSI to reduce your INS configuration time.\n2.    Make sure you activate your data link and SA page for better situational awareness.\n3.    Remember when flying with your wingman, give him time to join you, he could well be catching up from a previous holding orbit. So, control your speed appropriately throughout the mission.\n4.    Put your TGP on standby, you never know when you might need it.\n5.    When using your TGP to view a target point given to you via coordinates the image may not show itself until you are under 50 miles. Moving the TGP around from the given target point before the image becomes clear will only confuse your search. If clouds obscure your target maneuver the aircraft to suit.\n6.    As per prescribed Case 1 procedures on approach contact the ABE at 50 miles out. Contact details will be relayed via radio and are also on your kneeboard.\n7.    Some of the USS Abraham Lincoln's accompanying ships have been laid out to describe the four points of the 5-mile circle adjacent the ABE which forms the basis of the Case 1 landing procedures. These can be used visually to fly an accurate 5-mile circle\n\n\nNOTES\n\n1.    Each mission has a kneeboard containing all essential information. Call kneeboard and select \"Previous Page\" once.\n2.    A lot of the communications are trigger based. Pilots will have to operate the radio for Carrier approaches and aerial refueling.\n3.    The design of the missions are trigger based and so it is important that you follow the route and any instructions to realise all the content and pass the mission.\n4.    THE GUARANTEED MISSION BYPASS OPTION IS AVAILABLE FOR SELECTION THROUGH THE F10 FUNCTION BUT ONLY FOR THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES OF A MISSION COMMENCING.\n\n\nGood luck, Enjoy!\n\n21\n\n" : "注意：在此版本中，SA6 已被替换为 SA 11，因此发射距离可能为 20 英里\n\n1.    你和“Wave”、“Ford Group”，即将开始你的第一次正式安全巡逻。发动机启动时间为 07:00，然后移动到指定的 CAT 并发射航向至 WP 1。保持 500 英尺高度，直到离开 ABE 的 7 英里区域。（保持航向直到无线电呼叫）。   “Wave” 将首先发射，然后在空中加入你\n2.    当指示时，前往 WP 2，高度 Angels 15。你将经过 Fujairah 机场控制区。\n3.    保持在 Angels 15 高度，并沿指定路线继续飞行。\n4.    从 WP 4 到 WP 7 进行巡逻。你的简报是寻找任何可疑的海军动向。\n5.    RTB\n\n正如 Stennis 一样，ABE 的甲板是一个嘈杂、繁忙的地方。当你获准启动发动机时，Springfield，一个由四架 Hornets 组成的小组，已经在 CAT 中准备就绪。他们前往类似的巡逻，但在阿联酋的西侧。加油机 Arco 也在发射序列中，他们将在西侧待命，根据需要为 Springfield 加油。Wave 在座舱盖关闭时给你一个孩子气的微笑。这是一个绝佳的飞行日！\n\n要完成此任务，你需要能够：在白天良好条件下从 ABE 起飞 / 操作你的雷达和 SA 页面 / 如果需要，使用 AIM9X 空对空导弹 / 使用 TGP 进行识别 / 使用无线电联系 ABE 进行进近和着陆 / 使用 Tacan 定位并设置前往 ABE 的航线 / 熟悉 Case 1 进近和着陆。\n\n确保你使用 F10 菜单响应请求以确认指令。\n\n通信\n\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 主频道 2  / Tacan 72X / ICSL 频道 11\n\n提示\n\n1.    启动时，使用你的 HSI 上的“Std Heading”按钮以减少 INS 配置时间。\n2.    确保你激活数据链和 SA 页面以获得更好的态势感知。\n3.    记住，当与你的僚机飞行时，给他时间加入你，他可能正在从先前的待命轨道追赶。因此，在整个任务中适当控制你的速度。\n4.    将你的 TGP 置于待命状态，你永远不知道什么时候可能需要它。\n5.    当使用你的 TGP 查看通过坐标给你的目标点时，图像可能在你低于 50 英里时才显示。在图像变清晰之前从给定目标点移动 TGP 只会混淆你的搜索。如果云层遮挡你的目标，机动飞机以适应。\n6.    根据规定的 Case 1 程序，在进近时，在 50 英里外联系 ABE。联系细节将通过无线电中继，并在你的膝板上。\n7.    USS Abraham Lincoln 的一些伴随舰船已被布置来描述 ABE 相邻的 5 英里圆的四个点，这构成了 Case 1 着陆程序的基础。这些可以视觉上用于飞行一个准确的 5 英里圆\n\n注释\n\n1.    每个任务都有一个膝板，包含所有重要信息。调用膝板并选择“上一页”一次。\n2.    许多通信是基于触发的。飞行员必须操作无线电进行航母进近和空中加油。\n3.    任务的设计是基于触发的，因此重要的是你遵循路线和任何指令以实现所有内容并通过任务。\n4.    保证任务绕过选项可通过 F10 功能选择，但仅限任务开始的前五分钟。\n\n祝你好运，玩得开心！\n21",

Things are very much like the Stennis and so you are starting to feel at home. The VFA-113 are a good cohesive group of pilots and you have been quickly accepted into the wing. In fact, both of your aircraft have already been updated with the \"Stingers\" livery. \n\nYou both miss flying through the green landscapes of the Caucuses but are getting used to the wall-to-wall browns and beiges of the desert region. The heat, however, is another issue, there is no doubt this climate is much more challenging than you had thought. It is impossible to close your canopy on deck without the ventilation system fully online.\n\nIt is becoming clear in the Ready Room briefings that CAG, back at the Stennis, had not overplayed the situation down here in the Gulf. The new IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) Leader 'Asad' seems intent on conflict. He has no respect for the size or power of the Allied Forces and will push the High Commands buttons whenever he gets the chance. He is, without a doubt, on a crusade to show his country the IRGC can take control of the Straits. There have been numerous encounters with shipping over the last few weeks. The GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) are getting extremely nervous and looking to the Task Force for security and protection. To this end the Command have organised an ever-increasing number of aerial patrols to ensure their security.\n\n\n" : "按要求，本版本不再强制开启乱流，如需可在个人设置中选择。\n\n注意：此版本中SA6已被替换为SA11，因此发射距离可能达20英里。\n\n过去几周，你们俩都已适应了在亚伯拉罕·林肯号上的生活。这里与斯坦尼斯号非常相似，因此你们开始有家的感觉。VFA-113中队的飞行员们凝聚力强，你们很快融入了这个飞行联队。事实上，你们的战机都已换上了“毒刺”涂装。\n\n你们俩都很怀念穿越高加索绿色地貌的飞行，但正逐渐适应沙漠地区连绵不绝的棕褐色调。然而，高温却是另一回事，毫无疑问这里的气候比想象中更具挑战性。甲板上若不将通风系统全开，根本不可能关闭座舱盖。\n\n从待命室的简报中可以明显看出，斯坦尼斯号上的联队长并未夸大波斯湾地区的局势。新任伊朗伊斯兰革命卫队领导人“阿萨德”似乎有意挑起冲突。他毫不尊重联军的力量与规模，一有机会就会挑战高层指挥部的底线。毫无疑问，他正发起一场“圣战”，企图向国内证明革命卫队有能力控制霍尔木兹海峡。过去几周已发生多次海上船只遭遇事件。海湾合作委员会日益紧张，正寻求特遣舰队提供安全保护。为此，指挥部已组织越来越频繁的空中巡逻以确保其安全。",

  "\n1.    You will start engines at 05:30 and head to the designated CAT. After launch you will continue at 500ft straight ahead until clear of ABE's 7-mile zone. (Maintain heading until radio call)\n2.    Continue en-route to WP1 at Angels 15 to the West side of the U.A.E. Note you will be transiting a couple of control zones.\n3.    Your brief is to check on the status of several static ships. They are at WP's 1 to 4. You are looking for signs of Boghammer activity. To inspect thoroughly you need to carry out low passes over each ship YOU NEED TO BE BELOW 1000FT\n4.    You must Plug with Texaco along the West coast before RTB. \n\nIt is another early start; your cockpit is filled with an orange glow emanating from the early morning sun, just showing its face over the Eastern horizon. There is even a slight chill in the air. As you bring the Hornet into life, Uzi and Dodge are already on their CATS. They will be patrolling in areas Alpha and Bravo. You will be covering area Charlie; you are looking forward to flying over Dubai in the morning light, as you signal the removal of the chocks. \n\nTo complete this mission, you will need to be able to : Launch from the ABE by day with good visibility / Be familiar with a \"Show of Strength\" / If necessary use your M20 gun / Use your TGP / Use radar in Sea mode / Use your radio to contact both Texaco and the ABE / Carry out a successful AtoA Refuel./ Use the Tacan to find and locate both Texaco and the ABE / Be able to carry out a Case 1 approach and landing on the ABE in good conditions.\n\nEnsure you respond to requests to confirm instructions using the F10 Menu. YOU WILL ALWAYS BE ASKED TO CONFIRM VIA THE F10 MENU ON COMPLETION OF A PLUG. IT IS IMPORTANT THIS IS DONE TO PROCEED WITH THE MISSION SUCCESSFULLY.\n\nCOMMS\n\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 Pri Channel 1  / Tacan 72X / ICSL Channel 11\nTexaco : 124.00 Pri Channel 2 / Tacan 10X\n\nTIPS\n\n1.    Use the \"Std Heading\" button on the HSI to reduce the INS calibration time. Also activate the data link and SA page for better situational awareness\n2.    Watch your fuel usage.\n3.    When checking the ships ensure your passes are below 1000 feet.\n4.    WHEN ENTERING 'PRECISION COORDINATES' ensure they have been selected on the HSI / Data page. Button along bottom row. You will also need to select the correct entry format. This will be Degrees / Minutes / Seconds / Decimal Seconds (00/00/00.00). The format can be selected on the HSI / Data /A/C page use the 'LATLN' button which is bottom right. AS WITH ALL FLIGHT MULTI-TASKING DISCIPLINE, TO SAVE TIME, THIS SHOULD BE SET UP IN THE CRUISE WHEN YOU HAVE LESS TO DO RATHER THAN WHEN YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO ENTER COORDINATES.\n5.    Boghammers are exceedingly difficult to spot and so use of the Sea Radar to them lock up and check with your ATFLIR is essential. Do not be confused with hits from the nearby oil rigs. Approach from the ships sighted bearing will make things much clearer. Currently standard map static ships do not appear to be visible on the DCS sea radar. \n6.    If giving a show of Force to Boghammers you will need to fly directly over them below 400 feet and at least 300 kts to be successful. RECENTLY THE SIGN THAT THEY HAVE ABANDONED THEIR ATTACK APPEARS TO BE THEM STOPPING AND SETTING OFF A WHITE SMOKE FLARE.\n7.    What ever you do you must not kill a Boghammer unless cleared hot. THIS WILL BE A COURT-MARTIAL AND MISSION FAIL.\n8.    If any Boghammers get to the ship it will be boarded, and it will be a mission fail. If there are more than one Boghammer deal with the ones nearest the ship first.\n9.    Your patrol area is quite close to several Iranian SAM sites. There is a chance you could get a warning, but these will not be a factor if you remain outside of their launch range.\n10.    You must refuel before returning. Make sure on completion of plug you confirm this to Strike using F10 function. THIS IS A MISSION SUCCESS REQUIREMENT.\n11.    Some of the USS Abraham Lincoln's accompanying ships have been laid out to describe the four points of the 5-mile circle adjacent the ABE which forms the basis of the Case 1 landing procedures. These can be used visually to fly an accurate 5-mile circle\n12.    When RTB contact the ABE at 50 miles as per case 1 procedure. (You may struggle to do this due to the ABE not yet appearing on the DCS radio list. In this case just keep trying until it appears, should be about 32 miles). Your stack height on return is 2000ft. There could be other aircraft landing when you return so maintain Case 1 pattern until you are given signal Charlie by ABE.\n\nNOTES\n\n1.    Each mission has a kneeboard containing all essential information. Call kneeboard and select \"previous page\" once.\n2.    A lot of the communications are trigger based. Pilots will have to operate the radio for Carrier approaches and aerial refueling.\n3.    You will not be able to locate tankers via Tacan until they have been requested in the mission.      (This by mission design to minimise resources for VR users). \n4.    The design of the missions are trigger based and so IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU FOLLOW THE ROUTE AND ANY INSTRUCTIONS to realise all the content and pass the mission.\n5.    THE GUARANTEED MISSION BYPASS MECHANISM IS AVAILABLE FOR SELECTION THROUGH THE F10 FUNCTION BUT ONLY FOR THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES OF A MISSION COMMENCING.\n\nGood luck, Enjoy!\n\n18\n" : "1.    你将在05:30启动引擎，前往指定的CAT。发射后，你将保持在500英尺高度直飞，直到离开ABE的7英里区域。（保持航向直到无线电呼叫）\n2.    继续前往WP1，在阿联酋西侧，高度Angels 15。注意你将穿越几个管制区。\n3.    你的简报是检查几艘静止船只的状态。它们位于WP1到WP4。你正在寻找Boghammer活动的迹象。为了彻底检查，你需要对每艘船进行低空飞越，你需要低于1000英尺。\n4.    你必须在RTB前与西海岸的Texaco进行插头加油。\n\n又是一个清晨的开始；你的驾驶舱充满了清晨太阳发出的橙色光芒，太阳刚刚从东方地平线露出脸来。空气中甚至有一丝寒意。当你启动大黄蜂时，Uzi和Dodge已经在他们的CATS上。他们将在Alpha和Bravo区域巡逻。你将覆盖Charlie区域；你期待着在晨光中飞越Dubai，当你发出移除轮挡的信号时。\n\n要完成这个任务，你需要能够：在良好能见度下白天从ABE发射 / 熟悉“展示力量” / 如有必要使用你的M20机炮 / 使用你的TGP / 在海上模式使用雷达 / 使用无线电联系Texaco和ABE / 执行成功的空对空加油。/ 使用Tacan找到并定位Texaco和ABE / 能够在良好条件下执行Case 1进近并在ABE上降落。\n\n确保使用F10菜单响应请求以确认指令。完成加油后，你总是需要通过F10菜单进行确认。这对于任务成功进行至关重要。\n\nCOMMS\n\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 Pri Channel 1  / Tacan 72X / ICSL Channel 11\nTexaco : 124.00 Pri Channel 2 / Tacan 10X\n\nTIPS\n\n1.    使用HSI上的“Std Heading”按钮以减少INS校准时间。同时激活数据链和SA页面以获得更好的态势感知。\n2.    注意你的燃油使用。\n3.    检查船只时，确保你的飞越低于1000英尺。\n4.    当输入“精确坐标”时，确保它们在HSI/数据页面上已选择。按钮沿底部行。你还需要选择正确的输入格式。这将是度/分/秒/十进制秒（00/00/00.00）。格式可以在HSI/数据/A/C页面上使用右下角的“LATLN”按钮选择。与所有飞行多任务纪律一样，为了节省时间，这应该在巡航时设置，当你事情较少时，而不是当你实际需要输入坐标时。\n5.    Boghammers极其难以发现，因此使用海上雷达锁定它们并用ATFLIR检查是必要的。不要被附近石油钻井平台的回波混淆。从船只的目视方位接近将使事情更清晰。目前标准地图上的静止船只似乎在DCS海上雷达上不可见。\n6.    如果对Boghammers展示力量，你需要直接飞越它们，低于400英尺且至少300节才能成功。最近，他们放弃攻击的迹象似乎是停止并发射白色烟雾信号弹。\n7.    无论你做什么，除非获得开火许可，否则绝不能杀死Boghammer。这将导致军事法庭和任务失败。\n8.    如果任何Boghammer到达船只，它将被登船，任务将失败。如果有多个Boghammer，首先处理离船最近的。\n9.    你的巡逻区域非常接近几个伊朗SAM站点。你可能收到警告，但如果你保持在他们的发射范围外，这些不会成为因素。\n10.    你必须在返回前加油。确保完成加油后，使用F10功能向Strike确认。这是任务成功的要求。\n11.    USS Abraham Lincoln的一些伴随舰船已被布置来描述ABE相邻的5英里圆的四个点，这形成了Case 1降落程序的基础。这些可以视觉上用于飞行准确的5英里圆。\n12.    当RTB时，根据case 1程序在50英里处联系ABE。（由于ABE尚未出现在DCS无线电列表中，你可能难以做到这一点。在这种情况下，继续尝试直到它出现，应该大约32英里）。你返回时的堆栈高度是2000英尺。当你返回时，可能有其他飞机降落，因此保持Case 1模式，直到ABE给出信号Charlie。\n\nNOTES\n\n1.    每个任务都有一个膝板，包含所有必要信息。调用膝板并选择“上一页”一次。\n2.    许多通信是基于触发的。飞行员将不得不操作无线电进行航母进近和空中加油。\n3.    在任务中请求之前，你将无法通过Tacan定位加油机。（这是任务设计，以最小化VR用户的资源）。\n4.    任务的设计是基于触发的，因此遵循路线和任何指令以实现所有内容并通过任务非常重要。\n5.    保证任务绕过机制可通过F10功能选择，但仅在任务开始的前五分钟内。\n\n祝你好运，享受！\n\n18",

  "AS REQUESTED, THIS VERSION NO LONGER ENFORCES TURBULENCE, SELECT IT IF YOU WISH IN YOUR OWN SETTINGS.\n\nYour sighting of the Sinkers has got Commands attention, they have a growing concern Asad is building up his Naval forces to make a pre-emptive strike on the Task Force. In response they are increasing their anti-submarine defences and patrols.\n\nOn the ground Asad has also been ramping up the 'Boghammer' action in the straits and there have been numerous attempts to board ships and commandeer them. None have taken place yet, but it has been more luck than judgement. In response Command are now instigating a larger number of aerial patrols. These to check shipping in the straits, to keep it safe. These are now taking the form of single aircraft patrols to double the area that can be covered by each wing.\n\n\nThe IRGC are still denying their involvement in any of these actions and blaming insurgents not within their control. The R.O.E. as a result, is still not to open fire, unless fired on. This, the worst of both worlds as far as you are concerned. You would much prefer an action where 'the gloves were off' and at least then, you would know where you stood in an engagement. As a substitute, a 'Show of Force' has been used to dissuade Boghammers. This entails FLYING DIRECTLY OVER THE BOGHAMMERS AT BELOW 400FT AND ABOVE 300KNTS.\n\nToday, you will fly a Boghammer patrol as a single aircraft flight to the West of the U.A.E.\n\n\n" : "应要求，此版本不再强制设置湍流，如需可在个人设置中选择。\n\n你们发现\"沉没者\"引起了指挥部的注意，他们越来越担心阿萨德正在集结海军力量，准备对特遣部队进行先发制人的打击。作为回应，他们正在加强反潜防御和巡逻。\n\n在地面上，阿萨德也在加紧在霍尔木兹海峡的\"博格锤\"行动，已发生多起企图登船并劫持船只的事件。目前尚未成功，但这更多是侥幸而非判断准确。作为回应，指挥部正在部署更多空中巡逻。这些巡逻旨在检查海峡内的船只，确保其安全。目前采用单机巡逻形式，以便每个机队能覆盖双倍区域。\n\n\n伊朗革命卫队仍否认参与任何此类行动，并归咎于其无法控制的叛乱分子。因此，交战规则仍规定不得开火，除非遭到攻击。对你而言，这可谓是最糟糕的情况。你更希望进行一场\"放开手脚\"的行动，至少那样在交战中能明确自身立场。作为替代方案，已采用\"武力展示\"来威慑博格锤快艇。这需要以低于400英尺高度、高于300节速度直接从博格锤快艇上方飞越。\n\n今天，你们将作为单机编队在阿联酋西部执行博格锤巡逻任务。",

It is probably only a matter of time before the Boghammers are successful. In reaction, the operations on board the ABE are becoming more intense. The reality being that there is large area to cover and the Boghammers are small, fast and numerous.\n\nLast night a new danger raised its head, a merchant ship was damaged by a mine. Luckily, it did not sink, but did result in some oil spillage. The ship is now being towed to harbour for repairs. Command has taken the view that Iran has now made the first strike, and from this point on, the IRGC cannot be allowed to lay any more mines in these busy waters. The 'Rules of Engagement' have now changed. In future, if craft are positively identified as mine layers, they will be dealt with using lethal force. This, to serve as a warning to others. \n\nIntel has confirmed, unsurprisingly, the mines are being laid throughout the night under cover of darkness. They are normally laid by a small cruiser accompanied by one or more Boghammers. A series of night patrols have been organised using, as before, single aircraft flights to cover a larger area. \n\nYou are on one such 'Search and Destroy' patrol tonight.\n\n\n" : "根据要求，此版本不再强制启用湍流，如需请在自行设置中选择。\n\n那是一次险胜，再多几分钟，“Mariana”很可能就被征用了。Boghammers成功可能只是时间问题。作为反应，ABE上的行动变得更加激烈。现实是覆盖区域广阔，而Boghammers小巧、快速且数量众多。\n\n昨晚出现了一个新的危险，一艘商船被水雷损坏。幸运的是，它没有沉没，但导致了一些石油泄漏。该船现正被拖往港口进行修理。指挥部认为伊朗现已发起首次打击，从此刻起，不允许IRGC在这些繁忙水域布设更多水雷。“交战规则”现已改变。今后，如果船只被确认为布雷船，将使用致命武力处理。此举，以警告他人。\n\n情报已确认，不出所料，水雷在夜间黑暗掩护下布设。它们通常由一艘小型巡洋舰在一或多艘Boghammers伴随下布设。已组织一系列夜间巡逻，如前所述，使用单机飞行覆盖更大区域。\n\n今晚，您就在这样一次“搜索与摧毁”巡逻中。",

  "\n1.    You are to start engines at 01:30 and head to the CAT as directed. You are then to launch and follow a Case 3 night-time departure protocol. Once clear of ABE you are to head to WP1 at Angels 10. You are to anchor here And Wait until you are joined by Dodge and Uzi.\n2.    Once joined you are to push to WP4 via WP's 2 & 3 at Angels 12. You will be transiting Fujairah's control zone. Between WP 2 and 3 Dodge and Uzi will depart in different directions to commence their patrols in different areas.\n3.    You are to commence your search for mine layers using your Sea Radar/TGP/FLIR along a line between WP4 and 5. Adjust height, as necessary. There will be numerous ships in the area, so you need to identify the mine layers. They comprise a small cruiser with accompanying Boghammers. \n4.    If Minelayers are identified, YOU MUST REPORT TO STRIKE AND AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS USING F10.\n5.    Texaco is in the area for you to plug prior to RTB. This is optional in this mission. \n\nThe weather is good, but YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO RELY ON YOUR TGP AND GOGS LIKE NEVER BEFORE.\n\nTo complete this mission, you will need to be able to: Launch from the Stennis by night good visibility / Use the weapons on board / Use the HSI & SA / Use Radar Sea Mode / Use the TGP FLIR for search / Use the Night Vision Goggles / Use Tacan for location of Texaco and ABE / Use radio to communicate with Texaco and ABE / Carry out A2A refuel at night (Optional this mission)/ make a Case 3 approach and landing on the ABE.\n\nCOMMS\n\nTexaco : 256.00 Pri Channel 1 / Tacan 10X\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 Pri Channel 2  / Tacan 72X / ICSL Channel 11\n\nTIPS\n\n1.    You will need to use the Night Vision Goggles for refuel. ENSURE YOU REQUEST THEY ARE FITTED BY THE GROUND CREW BEFORE YOU FLY. Otherwise you will not be able to use them when airborne.\n2.    Use the 'Std Heading' procedure to save time configuring the INS.\n3.    Mine layers, if any, will be between WP 4 and 5 DO NOT WANDER MUCH FROM THIS LINE.\n4.    Since the introduction of the Radar Sea mode the search process for mine layers has become much easier. Set up the Sea Radar and lock up ships. Then by switching to the ATFLIR the ship targeted can be identified quickly. By working through radar ship contacts the mine layers can be quickly located. They are normally a cruiser with some Boghammers in attendance.\n5.    It is critical that any Mine layer located is positively identified by Strike prior to attack. AN ATTACK WITHOUT STRIKE CLEARANCE WILL BE A MISSION FAIL. To make positive ID you will be asked to send an image of the suspected mine layer back to Strike using F10 function. You must be within 2 miles of the mine layer to allow a positive ID. If the mine layer is targeted, you will have a distance read out on your HUD to help assess this. Best to send the image when overhead. NOTE MORE THAN TWO ATTEMPTS TO DO THIS WITHIN THE 2 MILES DISTANCE WILL BE A MISSION FAIL.\n6.    Air to air refueling is optional in the mission.    \n7.    When executing the Case 3 approach the stack will be 21 Miles behind the ABE. This is best located by setting Tacan and entering ships course. \n8.    As part of the Case 3 procedure you will be given a time to commence your approach from the hold. If you decide to commence before this time, to save time, you will still be able to pass this mission. Strict compliance of the commencement time is not a Mission success criterion.\n9.    Ensure you respond to requests to confirm instructions using the F10 Menu. YOU WILL ALWAYS BE ASKED TO CONFIRM VIA THE F10 MENU ON COMPLETION OF A PLUG. IT IS IMPORTANT THIS IS DONE TO PROCEED WITH THE MISSION SUCCESSFULLY.\n\nNOTES\n\n1.    Each mission has a kneeboard containing all essential information. Select Kneeboard and 'Previous page' once.\n2.    You will not be able to locate tankers via Tacan until they have been requested in the mission.      (This by mission design to minimise resources for VR users). \n3.    A lot of the communications are trigger based. Pilots will have to operate the radio for Carrier approaches and aerial refueling.\n4.    The design of the missions are trigger based and SO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU FOLLOW THE ROUTE AND ANY INSTRUCTIONS to realise all the content and pass the mission.\n5.    THE GUARANTEED MISSION BYPASS MECHANISM IS AVAILABLE FOR SELECTION THROUGH THE F10 FUNCTION BUT ONLY FOR THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES OF A MISSION COMMENCING.\n\nGood luck, Enjoy!\n\n18\n" : "1. 你需要在01:30启动发动机，并按指示前往弹射器。然后起飞并遵循Case 3夜间离场协议。一旦离开ABE，你应前往WP1，高度10000英尺。在此处锚定并等待，直到与Dodge和Uzi会合。\n2. 会合后，你应通过WP2和WP3前往WP4，高度12000英尺。你将穿越Fujairah的控制区。在WP2和WP3之间，Dodge和Uzi将分道扬镳，开始在不同区域巡逻。\n3. 你应开始使用海面雷达/TGP/FLIR在WP4和WP5之间的线上搜索布雷舰。根据需要调整高度。该区域将有众多船只，因此你需要识别布雷舰。它们包括一艘小型巡洋舰和伴随的Boghammers。\n4. 如果识别出布雷舰，你必须向STRIKE报告并使用F10等待指令。\n5. Texaco在该区域可供你在返航前进行加油。此任务中此项为可选。\n\n要完成此任务，你需要能够：在夜间良好能见度下从Stennis起飞 / 使用机载武器 / 使用HSI和SA / 使用雷达海面模式 / 使用TGP FLIR进行搜索 / 使用夜视镜 / 使用Tacan定位Texaco和ABE / 使用无线电与Texaco和ABE通信 / 在夜间进行空中加油（此任务可选）/ 在ABE上进行Case 3进近和着陆。\n\n通信\nTexaco：256.00 主频道1 / Tacan 10X\nUSS Abraham Lincoln：127.50 主频道2 / Tacan 72X / ICSL 频道11\n\n1. 你需要使用夜视镜进行加油。确保在飞行前请求地勤人员安装。否则，在空中时将无法使用。\n2. 使用“标准航向”程序以节省配置INS的时间。\n3. 布雷舰（如果有的话）将在WP4和WP5之间，不要过多偏离此线。\n4. 自从引入雷达海面模式后，搜索布雷舰的过程变得容易多了。设置海面雷达并锁定船只。然后通过切换到ATFLIR，可以快速识别目标船只。通过处理雷达船只接触，可以快速定位布雷舰。它们通常是一艘巡洋舰，伴有Boghammers。\n5. 至关重要的是，任何定位的布雷舰在攻击前必须由Strike确认识别。未经Strike许可的攻击将导致任务失败。为了进行确认识别，你会被要求使用F10功能将可疑布雷舰的图像发送回Strike。你必须在布雷舰2英里范围内以允许确认识别。如果布雷舰被锁定，你将在HUD上看到距离读数以帮助评估。最好在正上方时发送图像。注意：在2英里距离内尝试超过两次将导致任务失败。\n6. 空中加油在此任务中为可选。\n7. 执行Case 3进近时，等待点将在ABE后方21英里处。最好通过设置Tacan和输入航向进行定位。\n8. 作为Case 3程序的一部分，你将获得从等待点开始进近的时间。如果你决定提前开始以节省时间，你仍然能通过此任务。严格遵守开始时间不是任务成功的标准。\n9. 确保使用F10菜单响应确认指令的请求。完成加油后，你总是会被要求通过F10菜单进行确认。这对于任务成功进行至关重要。\n\n1. 每个任务都有一个膝板，包含所有重要信息。选择膝板并点击“上一页”一次。\n2. 在任务中请求之前，你将无法通过Tacan定位加油机。（这是任务设计，以减少VR用户的资源使用。）\n3. 许多通信是基于触发的。飞行员将需要操作无线电进行航母进近和空中加油。\n4. 任务设计是基于触发的，因此遵循航线和任何指令以实现所有内容并通过任务非常重要。\n5. 保证任务绕过机制可通过F10功能选择，但仅在任务开始后的前五分钟内可用。\n\n祝你好运，享受飞行！18",

  "AS REQUESTED, THIS VERSION NO LONGER ENFORCES TURBULENCE, SELECT IT IF YOU WISH IN YOUR OWN SETTINGS.\n\nWith the success of your last patrol and the many more like it across the wing, it was clear the I.R.G.C. were struggling to achieve the desired impact on the Straits. Their leader, Asad, was aware he could not just rely on the Boghammer and mine laying operations, he needed to do more.\n\nAs always happens in these sorts of conflicts, change was afoot. This time much to the embarrassment of the Task Force and Central Command. Two days ago, the \"Batillus\", a French merchant ship was boarded and commandeered by 'Takavar' Special Forces who had been dropped in using Iranian helos. The ship had then been forced to route to the island of Abu Musa where it remains under heavy guard. The I.R.G.C. have made it clear, unless sanctions are lifted, that is where the Batillus will remain. It is clear Asad has now become much more brazen and is no longer denying Iran's responsibility in these matters.\n\nIn response, the Task Force have now stepped up the patrols, and much to your relief, restored two ship flights. It is good to be back flying with 'Wave' your wingman. The team is back together. \n\nYou are preparing for yet another patrol when the ABE receive a distress call from the ship \"Rowan\". There are suspect Helos in the area who are not responding to the Rowans communication attempts. They fear it may be the start of an attempt to board them. Ford group are to head there ASAP. \n\n\n\n" : "按请求，此版本不再强制湍流，如果您愿意，请在您自己的设置中选择它。\n\n随着你上一次巡逻的成功以及整个联队中更多类似的巡逻，很明显I.R.G.C.在努力实现对海峡的期望影响时遇到困难。他们的领导人Asad意识到，他不能仅仅依赖Boghammer和布雷行动，他需要做更多。\n\n正如这类冲突中常发生的那样，变化正在发生。这一次，让特遣部队和中央司令部非常尴尬。两天前，法国商船\"Batillus\"被使用伊朗直升机降落的'Takavar'特种部队登船并劫持。该船随后被迫前往阿布穆萨岛，目前仍在严密守卫下。I.R.G.C.已明确表示，除非制裁解除，否则Batillus将留在那里。很明显，Asad现在变得更加肆无忌惮，不再否认伊朗在这些事件中的责任。\n\n作为回应，特遣部队现已加强巡逻，并令你欣慰的是，恢复了双机飞行。很高兴能再次与你的僚机'Wave'一起飞行。团队重新聚在一起。\n\n当你准备进行另一次巡逻时，ABE收到了来自船只\"Rowan\"的求救呼叫。该区域有可疑直升机，它们没有回应Rowan的通信尝试。他们担心这可能是登船企图的开始。Ford小组要尽快前往那里。",

Wave will launch first and join you when airborne.\n2.    Arco, who is just taking off, will remain in the Khasab area for a 'top off' after your patrol prior to RTB. (A2A refuel prior to RTB is mandatory in this mission for mission success)\n \nIt is early morning and there is a low-level fog, this tinted with the early morning sunrise. You lower yourself into the Hornet and give a thumbs up to Wave. Uzi and Dodge are already on the CAT's, they are responding to a similar call, this must be a coordinated action. Arco is just starting to taxi.  Your heart starts to race as you wonder what you are going to find when you get to the Rowan. Are you going to be too late?\n\nTo complete this mission, you will need to be able to: Launch from ABE in good conditions but low level fog/ Enter 'Precision' co-ordinates when in the air as issued by Strike (see TIPS below) / Use weapons in your load out as directed / Use Tacan to locate Arco and ABE / Use radar, SA page, data Link to locate \"Wave\" / Use radio to contact Arco and ABE /Carry out A2A refuel, not optional./ Carry out Case 3 approach and landing on ABE with low level fog.\n\nEnsure you respond to requests to confirm instructions using the F10 Menu. YOU WILL ALWAYS BE ASKED TO CONFIRM VIA THE F10 MENU ON COMPLETION OF A PLUG. IT IS IMPORTANT THIS IS DONE TO PROCEED WITH THE MISSION SUCCESSFULLY.\n\n\nCOMMS\n\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 Pri Channel 1 / Tacan 72X / ICSL Channel 11.\nArco : 251.00 Pri Channel 2 / Tacan 10X \n\nTIPS\n\n1.    When starting, use the \"Std Heading\" button on your HSI to REDUCE YOUR INS CONFIGURATION TIME.\n2.    Make sure you activate your data link and SA page for better situational awareness.\n3.    Put your TGP on standby, you never know when you might need it.\n4.    WHEN ENTERING 'PRECISION COORDINATES' ensure they have been selected on the HSI / Data page. Button along bottom row. You will also need to select the correct entry format. This will be Degrees / Minutes / Seconds / Decimal Seconds (00/00/00.00). The format can be selected on the HSI / Data /A/C page use the 'LATLN' button which is bottom right. AS WITH ALL FLIGHT MULTI-TASKING DISCIPLINE, TO SAVE TIME, THIS SHOULD BE SET UP PRIOR WHEN YOU HAVE LESS TO DO RATHER THAN WHEN YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO ENTER COORDINATES.\n5.    Make sure you DO NOT DAMAGE THE ROWAN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS A MISSION FAIL. (Downed aircraft falling on the Rowan will damage the ship.) \n6.    YOU MUST REFUEL BEFORE RETURNING. Make sure on completion of plug, you confirm this to Strike using F10 function. MISSION REQUIREMENT.\n7.    When RTB contact the ABE at 50 miles as per procedure. (NOTE: You may struggle to do this due to the ABE not yet appearing on the DCS radio list. In this case just keep trying until it appears, should be about 32 miles).\n8.    You will have to carry out a Case 3 approach on your return. To help, a single ship has been provided at the designated hold area for the Case 3 approach. (21 Miles behind the ABE). Best to use Tacan and enter ships course to give line and distance to locate hold position.\n9.    In line with the Case 3 procedure will be given a time to commence your approach from the hold. If you decide to commence before this time, to save time, you will still be able to pass this mission. Strict compliance of the commencement time is not a Mission success criterion.\n\nNOTES\n\n1.    Each mission has a kneeboard containing all essential information.\n2.    A lot of the communications are trigger based. Pilots will have to operate the radio for Carrier approaches and aerial refueling.\n3.    You will not be able to locate tankers via Tacan until they have been requested in the mission.      (This by mission design to minimise resources for VR users).\n4.    The design of the missions are trigger based and so it is important that you follow the route and any instructions to realise all the content and pass the mission.\n5.    THE GUARANTEED MISSION BYPASS MECHANISM IS AVAILABLE FOR SELECTION THROUGH THE F10 FUNCTION BUT ONLY FOR THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES OF A MISSION COMMENCING.\n\nGood luck, Enjoy!\n\n28\n" : "1.    你和Wave，Ford Group，将进行标准离场，直飞7英里并等待进一步指示。（保持航向直到无线电呼叫）。Wave将首先起飞，升空后加入你。\n2.    Arco，刚刚起飞，将在你巡逻后返回基地前留在Khasab区域进行“加油”。（在本任务中，返回基地前进行空对空加油是任务成功所必需的。）\n\n清晨时分，有低空雾，晨曦映照其中。你坐进大黄蜂，向Wave竖起大拇指。Uzi和Dodge已经在弹射器上，他们正在响应类似的呼叫，这一定是一次协调行动。Arco刚刚开始滑行。你的心跳开始加速，当你想到到达Rowan时会发现什么。你会不会太晚？\n\n要完成此任务，你需要能够：在良好条件但低空雾中从ABE起飞/ 在空中输入Strike发布的“精确”坐标（见下方提示）/ 按指示使用你挂载的武器/ 使用Tacan定位Arco和ABE/ 使用雷达、SA页面、数据链定位“Wave”/ 使用无线电联系Arco和ABE/ 执行空对空加油，非可选。/ 在低空雾中执行Case 3进近并降落在ABE上。\n\n确保使用F10菜单响应请求以确认指令。完成加油后，你将始终被要求通过F10菜单确认。这对成功推进任务至关重要。\n\n\n通信\n\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 主频道 1 / Tacan 72X / ICSL 频道 11。\nArco : 251.00 主频道 2 / Tacan 10X \n\n提示\n\n1.    开始时，使用HSI上的“标准航向”按钮以减少你的INS配置时间。\n2.    确保激活数据链和SA页面以获得更好的态势感知。\n3.    将你的TGP置于待命状态，你永远不知道何时会需要它。\n4.    输入“精确坐标”时，确保它们已在HSI/数据页面上选中。底部行的按钮。你还需要选择正确的输入格式。这将是度/分/秒/十进制秒（00/00/00.00）。格式可以在HSI/数据/A/C页面上使用右下角的“LATLN”按钮选择。与所有飞行多任务纪律一样，为了节省时间，这应在你空闲时提前设置，而不是在需要输入坐标时。\n5.    确保在任何情况下都不要损坏Rowan。这是任务失败。（被击落的飞机坠落在Rowan上会损坏船只。）\n6.    你必须在返回前加油。确保加油完成后，使用F10功能向Strike确认。任务要求。\n7.    返回时，按程序在50英里处联系ABE。（注意：由于ABE尚未出现在DCS无线电列表中，你可能难以做到这一点。在这种情况下，只需持续尝试直到它出现，应该在约32英里处。）\n8.    你需要在返回时执行Case 3进近。为了帮助，在Case 3进近的指定等待区域提供了一艘单独的船只。（在ABE后方21英里处。）最好使用Tacan并输入船只航向以给出线和距离来定位等待位置。\n9.    根据Case 3程序，你将获得一个从等待区开始进近的时间。如果你决定提前开始以节省时间，你仍然能够通过此任务。严格遵守开始时间不是任务成功标准。\n\n注意\n\n1.    每个任务都有一个膝板，包含所有重要信息。\n2.    许多通信是基于触发的。飞行员将需要操作无线电进行航母进近和空中加油。\n3.    在任务中请求之前，你将无法通过Tacan定位加油机。（这是任务设计，以最小化VR用户的资源。）\n4.    任务设计是基于触发的，因此遵循航线和任何指令以体验所有内容并通过任务非常重要。\n5.    保证任务绕过机制可通过F10功能选择，但仅限于任务开始后的前五分钟。\n\n祝你好运，享受！\n\n28",

  "1.    Start engines whilst awaiting 'Precise' coordinates. Whilst you wait, 'Wave' will launch and orbit awaiting your launch. KEEP BELOW 250KNTS UNTIL WAVE JOINS YOU.\n2.    Deal with insurgent attack, as instructed.   \n3.    Plug with Arco on your return, if required, RTB. (A2A refuel is not mandatory in this mission).\n\nAs you both quickly make your way to your aircraft you are stopped by CAG, you tell 'Wave' to go on ahead. CAG stresses you have got to stop whatever is going down, \"the Task Force cannot be undermined in this way\". \"Teach them a bloody lesson\" he shouts after you, as you head down the corridor to the upper deck. Luckily, the weather is good and there is a full moon, so visibility will be reasonable. You lower yourself into your pit; Wave is already on CAT. Arco is preparing to get in position. As you bring your machine into life you wait impatiently for the precise coordinates. You need to go..\n\nTo complete this mission, you will need to be able to: Launch from ABE in good conditions at night/ Enter Precise co-ordinates when issued / Use weapons in your load out as directed / Use your targeting pod / Use your radar in GMT mode / Use Tacan to locate Arco and ABE / Use SA page, data Link / Use NVG's / Use radio to contact Arco and ABE / Carry out A2A refuel if required ( This is not mandatory for this mission)  / Carry out Case 3 approach and landing on ABE at night.\n\nEnsure you respond to requests to confirm instructions using the F10 Menu. YOU WILL ALWAYS BE ASKED TO CONFIRM VIA THE F10 MENU ON COMPLETION OF A PLUG. IT IS IMPORTANT THIS IS DONE TO PROCEED WITH THE MISSION SUCCESSFULLY. \n\nCOMMS\n\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 Pri Channel 1  / Tacan 72X / ICSL Channel 11\nArco : 315.00 Pri Channel 2 / Tacan 10X\n\nTIPS\n\n1.    You will need to use the Night Vision Goggles. ENSURE YOU REQUEST THEY ARE FITTED BY THE GROUND CREW BEFORE YOU FLY. Otherwise, you will not be able to use them when airborne.\n2.    Use the \"Std Heading\" button on the HSI TO REDUCE THE INS CALIBRATION TIME. Also activate the data link and SA page for better situational awareness\n3.    WHEN ENTERING 'PRECISION COORDINATES' ensure they have been selected on the HSI / Data page. Button along bottom row. You will also need to select the correct entry format. This will be Degrees / Minutes / Seconds / Decimal Seconds (00/00/00.00). The format can be selected on the HSI / Data /A/C page use the 'LATLN' button which is bottom right.\n4.    Remember when flying with your wingman, give him time to join you, he could well be catching up from a previous holding orbit. So, control your speed appropriately throughout the mission.\n5.    Watch your fuel.\n6.    Put your TGP on standby, you never know when you might need it.\n7.    Any potential moving ground targets will need to be identified and reported to Strike before attack. This will mean use of your Radar in GMT mode to locate and TGP to identify. \n8.    When using AGM-65F Mavericks with the Radar in GMT mode suggest you get close to the target before firing whilst caging and uncaging the maverick until you are sure you have a lock. For some reason it seems long distance shots often lose lock and miss.  \n9.    Best way to locate Case 3 stack behind the ABE is to use Tacan and enter ships course to give line and distance. \n10.    As part of the Case 3 procedure, you will be given a time to commence your approach from the hold. If you decide to commence before this time, to save time, you will still be able to pass this mission. Strict compliance of the commencement time is not a Mission success criterion.\n\nNOTES\n\n1.    Each mission has a kneeboard containing all essential information.\n2.    A lot of the communications are trigger based. Pilots will have to operate the radio for Carrier approaches and aerial refueling.\n3.    The design of the missions are trigger based and so it is important that you follow the route and any instructions to realise all the content and pass the mission.\n4.    You will not be able to locate tankers via Tacan until they have been requested in the mission.      (This by mission design to minimise resources for VR users). \n5.    THE GUARANTEED MISSION BYPASS MECHANISM IS AVAILABLE FOR SELECTION THROUGH THE F10 FUNCTION BUT ONLY FOR THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES OF A MISSION COMMENCING.\n\nGood luck, Enjoy!\n\n22\n" : "1.    在等待“精确”坐标时启动引擎。在你等待期间，“Wave”将起飞并盘旋等待你的起飞。在与Wave汇合前保持低于250节。\n2.    按照指示处理叛军攻击。   \n3.    返航时如果需要，与Arco进行空中加油，然后返回基地。(本任务中空中加油不是强制性的)。\n\n当你们俩快速走向飞机时，被CAG拦住，你告诉“Wave”先走。CAG强调你必须阻止正在发生的事，“特遣部队不能以这种方式被削弱”。“给他们一个血的教训”他在你身后喊道，当你沿着走廊走向上层甲板时。幸运的是，天气良好，有满月，所以能见度将不错。你坐进驾驶舱；Wave已经在弹射器上。Arco正准备就位。当你启动飞机时，你不耐烦地等待精确坐标。你需要出发了..\n\n要完成此任务，你需要能够：在夜间良好条件下从ABE起飞/在发布时输入精确坐标/按照指示使用挂载武器/使用你的目标吊舱/在GMT模式下使用雷达/使用Tacan定位Arco和ABE/使用SA页面、数据链/使用NVG's/使用无线电联系Arco和ABE/如果需要执行A2A加油（本任务中非强制）/执行Case 3进近并在夜间降落在ABE上。\n\n确保使用F10菜单响应确认指令的请求。完成加油后，你将始终被要求通过F10菜单确认。这一点很重要，以便成功推进任务。\n\n通信\n\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 主频道 1 / Tacan 72X / ICSL 频道 11\nArco : 315.00 主频道 2 / Tacan 10X\n\n提示\n\n1.    你需要使用夜视镜。确保在飞行前请求地勤人员安装。否则，在空中时将无法使用它们。\n2.    使用HSI上的“Std Heading”按钮以减少INS校准时间。同时激活数据链和SA页面以提升态势感知。\n3.    输入“精确坐标”时，确保已在HSI/数据页面上选择。按钮在底部一行。你还需要选择正确的输入格式。这将是度/分/秒/小数秒(00/00/00.00)。格式可以在HSI/数据/A/C页面上使用右下角的“LATLN”按钮选择。\n4.    记住与僚机飞行时，给他时间加入你，他可能正在从先前的等待轨道赶上。因此，在整个任务中适当控制你的速度。\n5.    注意你的燃油。\n6.    将你的TGP置于待命状态，你永远不知道何时可能需要它。\n7.    任何潜在的移动地面目标需要在攻击前识别并报告给Strike。这将意味着使用雷达在GMT模式下定位，并使用TGP识别。\n8.    使用AGM-65F Mavericks与雷达在GMT模式下时，建议在发射前接近目标，同时不断caging和uncaging maverick直到确保锁定。由于某种原因，远距离射击往往会失去锁定并脱靶。\n9.    定位ABE后方Case 3堆栈的最佳方法是使用Tacan并输入船舶航向以提供线和距离。\n10.   作为Case 3程序的一部分，你将获得一个从等待点开始进近的时间。如果你决定在此之前开始以节省时间，你仍然能够通过此任务。严格遵守开始时间不是任务成功的标准。\n\n注意事项\n\n1.    每个任务都有一个膝盖板，包含所有基本信息。\n2.    许多通信是基于触发器的。飞行员需要操作无线电进行航母进近和空中加油。\n3.    任务设计是基于触发器的，因此遵循路线和任何指示以实现所有内容并通过任务很重要。\n4.    在任务中请求之前，你将无法通过Tacan定位加油机。(这是任务设计，以最小化VR用户的资源)。\n5.    保证任务旁路机制可通过F10功能选择，但仅在任务开始的前五分钟内。\n\n祝你好运，玩得开心！\n\n22",

  "AS REQUESTED, THIS VERSION NO LONGER ENFORCES TURBULENCE, SELECT IT IF YOU WISH IN YOUR OWN SETTINGS.\n\nOnce again, 'Ford Group' have been in the limelight, the Oman authorities thanked the Task Force for halting the covert insurgent operation at Sohar. It has become clear that the insurgents were heading to attack Al Ain airport. If you had not stopped them, there would have been a total massacre. It seems there is no depths to which Asad will stoop to reach his objectives.\n\n\nThe fact the Iranians are still holding the French merchant ship, Batillus, at Abu Musa is causing our High Command more and more embarrassment each day. It is a constant reminder to the G.C.C and allied countries that this had happened on this Task Force's watch. Asad, is also ensuring the allies are not allowed to forget it, with a barrage of propaganda aimed to promote the position of the I.R.G.C. in Iran and decrease our allies confidence in this Task Force\n\n\n\"Enough is enough\", as the Admiral put it. Today there is to be a multi-pronged attack to secure the safe release of the Batillus. Ford Group will play an important part in this. \n\n\n" : "如请求所示，此版本不再强制湍流，如果您希望，请在您自己的设置中选择它。\n\n再次，“福特小组”成为焦点，阿曼当局感谢特遣部队在苏哈尔阻止了秘密叛乱行动。现已清楚，叛乱分子正前往攻击艾因机场。如果你们没有阻止他们，将会发生一场大屠杀。似乎阿萨德为了达到目标会不择手段。\n\n伊朗人仍在阿布穆萨扣押法国商船 Batillus 的事实，每天都在给我们的最高指挥部带来越来越多的尴尬。这不断提醒 G.C.C. 和盟国，这发生在这支特遣部队的监视下。阿萨德还通过一连串的宣传确保盟国不会忘记此事，旨在提升 I.R.G.C. 在伊朗的地位，并降低盟国对这支特遣部队的信心。\n\n“受够了”，正如海军上将所说。今天将进行一次多管齐下的攻击，以确保 Batillus 的安全释放。福特小组将在此中扮演重要角色。",

  "\n1.    Ford are to carry out a standard departure from the ABE at 500 feet to WP1. (410, Wave, will launch before you but hold in an orbit until you are airborne.)  \n2.    Then head to WP2 at Angels 12 and anchor there.\n3.    Hatchet a flight of two Hornets will already have set up an orbit to the South. At time 4 5 precisely they will declare Code word \"Skylark\", they will then commence a SEAD attack of the two SAM sites on Abu Musa.\n4.    When Hatchet declare Code word \"Freedom\", this will signal the SAM sites are down. You, Ford Group, are to then push to Abu Musa and take out the AAA gun emplacement on the South East tip of the island adjacent a crossroads. Once destroyed, you are to engage any aircraft on the ground before they can take off. YOU MUST STOP THEM GETTING AIRBORNE USING GUN. Once complete you will give Code Word \"Hammer\". \n5.    Once you declare Code word \"Hammer\", Sabre, a flight of 3 attack helicopters will commence their push and attack any troops on the ground or Boghammers guarding the Batillus. \n6.    Once clear, Lifter will approach the Batillus and drop Special Forces to secure the ship. During this, you will be tasked with C.A.S.\n7.    You are to maintain C.A.S. until the Batillus leaves harbour.\n8.    Texaco is in the area for a plug prior to Ford Group RTB. (This is not mandatory in this mission but may be wise).       \n\nIt is another beautiful morning in the Gulf and your cockpit is again awash with crimson. You are snapped back to reality as \"Wave\" is given clearance. Better get your game face on, there is a ship to save.. \n\nTo complete this mission, you will need to be able to:  Launch from the ABE by day with good visibility / Use the weapons you have on board / Use the TGP, radar, data link and SA Page / Use your SA page to relocate and join up with 'Wave' / Use Tacan to locate Texaco and ABE / carry out an AtoA refuel / Use radio to contact Texaco and ABE / Carry out a Case 1 approach and landing on the ABE in good conditions. \n\nCOMMS\n\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 Pri Channel 1  / Tacan 72X / ICSL Channel 11\nTexaco : 326.00 Pri Channel 2 / Tacan 10X\n\nTIPS\n\n1.    You will need to carry out your start up and launch as quickly as you can to get to WP2 by time 4 5. (This is not a mission fail criteria if you are late. If you have a slower start do not go full burner to make up time, still fly at a speed to allow 410 to easily join you. Remember 410 will use more fuel to catch up  and keep in formation. There is a risk he will run out of fuel and leave the mission as a result ) \n2.    Watch your full state throughout only push it when you have to.\n3.    When starting, use the \"Std Heading\" button on your HSI to REDUCE YOUR INS CONFIGURATION TIME.\n4.    Make sure you activate your data link and SA page for better situational awareness.\n5.    Put your TGP on standby, you never know when you might need it.\n6.    Once established in orbit over WP2 note your location with a ground visual reference. Easier to maintain orbit position visually rather than using the HSI, this also allowing you to keep your head outside the cockpit.\n7.    Have patience when established in the orbit over WP2. The HARM missiles released by Hatchet Group will have 33 miles to travel to their SAM targets. A good time to set up weapons etc. \n8.    Way point 3 is the ground location of the Batillus. You will need to search from this point to locate the AAA gun, see maps. \n9.    When using your TGP and AGM65F to take out the AAA Gun on the island, you will need to cage and uncage the Maverick numerous times, even though you have a TGP lock. THIS UNTIL YOU ARE SURE YOUR MAVERICK TARGETS THE GUN EMPLACEMENT AND NOT THE VEHICLE OR BUILDING CLOSE BY. You will have to release closer than 10 miles to be sure. Location shown on attached map.\n10.    When RTB contact the ABE at 50 miles as per Case 1 procedure. (You may struggle to do this due to the ABE not yet appearing on the DCS radio list. In this case just keep trying until it appears, should be about 32 miles). Your stack height on return is 2000ft. There could be other aircraft landing when you return so maintain Case 1 pattern until you are given signal Charlie by ABE.\n11.    Some of the USS Abraham Lincoln's accompanying ships have been laid out to describe the four points of the 5-mile circle adjacent the ABE which forms the basis of the Case 1 landing procedures. These can be used visually to fly an accurate 5-mile circle\n\nNOTES\n\n1.    Each mission has a kneeboard containing all essential information.\n2.    A lot of the communications are trigger based. Pilots will have to operate the radio for Carrier approaches and aerial refueling.\n3.    You will not be able to locate tankers via Tacan until they have been requested in the mission.      (This by mission design to minimise resources for VR users).\n4.    The design of the missions are trigger based and so it is important that you follow the route and any instructions to realise all the content and pass the mission.\n5.    THE GUARANTEED MISSION BYPASS MECHANISM IS AVAILABLE FOR SELECTION THROUGH THE F10 FUNCTION BUT ONLY FOR THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES OF A MISSION COMMENCING.\n\n\nGood luck, Enjoy!\n\n28" : "1.    Ford 将从 ABE 标准起飞，高度 500 英尺，前往 WP1。（410，呼号 Wave，将在你之前起飞，但会在轨道上等待，直到你升空。）  \n2.    然后前往 WP2，高度 Angels 12，并在那里锚定。\n3.    Hatchet，一个双机 F/A-18 编队，已经在其南侧建立了轨道。在时间 4 5 整，他们将宣布代码词 \"Skylark\"，然后开始对 Abu Musa 上的两个 SAM 站点进行 SEAD 攻击。\n4.    当 Hatchet 宣布代码词 \"Freedom\" 时，这表示 SAM 站点已被摧毁。你，Ford 编队，然后将推进到 Abu Musa，并摧毁岛东南端交叉路口附近的高射炮阵地。一旦摧毁，你需要在地面飞机起飞前攻击它们。你必须使用机炮阻止它们升空。完成后，你将给出代码词 \"Hammer\"。 \n5.    一旦你宣布代码词 \"Hammer\"，Sabre，一个三架攻击直升机编队，将开始推进并攻击地面部队或守卫 Batillus 的 Boghammers。 \n6.    一旦清除，Lifter 将接近 Batillus 并投送特种部队以控制该船。在此期间，你将负责 C.A.S.。\n7.    你需要维持 C.A.S. 直到 Batillus 离开港口。\n8.    Texaco 在该区域，供 Ford 编队 RTB 前进行加油。（在此任务中非强制，但可能明智。）       \n\n这是波斯湾又一个美丽的早晨，你的座舱再次沐浴在深红色中。当 \"Wave\" 获得许可时，你被拉回现实。最好准备好你的游戏面孔，有一艘船需要拯救。\n\n要完成此任务，你需要能够：在良好能见度下从 ABE 白天起飞 / 使用机载武器 / 使用 TGP、雷达、数据链和 SA 页面 / 使用 SA 页面重新定位并与 'Wave' 汇合 / 使用 Tacan 定位 Texaco 和 ABE / 执行空对空加油 / 使用无线电联系 Texaco 和 ABE / 在良好条件下执行 Case 1 进场并在 ABE 上降落。\n\nCOMMS\n\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 主频道 1  / Tacan 72X / ICSL 频道 11\nTexaco : 326.00 主频道 2 / Tacan 10X\n\nTIPS\n\n1.    你需要尽快启动和起飞，以便在时间 4 5 到达 WP2。（如果你迟到，这不是任务失败标准。如果你启动较慢，不要全加力补时，仍以允许 410 轻松加入的速度飞行。记住 410 将使用更多燃料来追赶并保持编队。有风险他可能会耗尽燃料并因此退出任务。） \n2.    全程监控你的燃油状态，只在必要时推进。\n3.    启动时，使用 HSI 上的 \"Std Heading\" 按钮以减少 INS 配置时间。\n4.    确保激活数据链和 SA 页面以获得更好的态势感知。\n5.    将 TGP 置于待命状态，你永远不知道何时可能需要它。\n6.    一旦在 WP2 上空建立轨道，用地面视觉参考记下你的位置。视觉上维持轨道位置比使用 HSI 更容易，这也允许你将头保持在座舱外。\n7.    在 WP2 上空建立轨道时要有耐心。Hatchet 编队发射的 HARM 导弹将飞行 33 英里到达 SAM 目标。这是设置武器等的好时机。 \n8.    航点 3 是 Batillus 的地面位置。你需要从这一点搜索以定位高射炮，见地图。 \n9.    当使用 TGP 和 AGM65F 摧毁岛上的高射炮时，你需要多次锁定和解锁 Maverick，即使你有 TGP 锁定。直到你确信你的 Maverick 目标是对准炮阵地而不是附近的车辆或建筑物。你必须确保在 10 英里内发射。位置见附图。\n10.    当 RTB 时，按照 Case 1 程序在 50 英里处联系 ABE。（由于 ABE 可能尚未出现在 DCS 无线电列表中，你可能会遇到困难。在这种情况下，继续尝试直到出现，大约应在 32 英里处）。你返回时的堆栈高度是 2000 英尺。当你返回时可能还有其他飞机降落，因此保持 Case 1 模式直到 ABE 给出 Charlie 信号。\n11.    USS Abraham Lincoln 的一些伴随舰船已被布置来描述与 ABE 相邻的 5 英里圆的四个点，这构成了 Case 1 降落程序的基础。这些可以视觉上用于飞行准确的 5 英里圆。\n\nNOTES\n\n1.    每个任务都有一个膝板，包含所有基本信息。\n2.    许多通信是基于触发的。飞行员将需要操作无线电进行航母进场和空中加油。\n3.    在任务中请求之前，你将无法通过 Tacan 定位加油机。（这是任务设计，以最小化 VR 用户的资源。）     \n4.    任务设计是基于触发的，因此遵循路线和所有指令以实现所有内容并通过任务很重要。\n5.    保证任务旁路机制可通过 F10 功能选择，但仅限任务开始的前五分钟。\n\n祝你好运，玩得开心！",

  "DUE TO CURRENT REFUEL BUG YOUR WING WILL NOT PLUG BUT STAY IN FORMATION. YOU NOW MUST PLUG ON LEFT BASKET UNTIL BUG FIXED.  \n\nAS REQUESTED, THIS VERSION NO LONGER ENFORCES TURBULENCE, SELECT IT IF YOU WISH IN YOUR OWN SETTINGS.\n\nThe release of the \"Batillus\" was dubbed a major success by the High Command. It had been a serious blow for Iran, the I.R.G.C. and Asad's authority. No longer could Asad use his propaganda machine to taunt and embarrass the Allied Forces and more importantly the Task Force.\n\nAboard the ABE the atmosphere was much more sombre, the death of your wingman Lt Larry Jackson, \"Wave\", had been a great loss and was felt throughout the crew, and most of all, by yourself. You had sunk into a deep depression over these last couple of weeks. During this time, the CO had made sure you were kept busy, and ensured you were flying regularly. There had also been a lot of support from the Wing. \n\nAt a joint meeting with XO and the CO you were paired up with your new Wingman. Lt Lee Anderson, a Southern boy. Call sign \"Matrix\", on account of the \"Mr Anderson\" reference from the film. You had seen him in the Ready Room on numerous occasions but had never had a great deal of dealings with him to date. After a few weeks of flying as a pair, it was becoming obvious that you would both make a good team. Although he was not another 'Wave' you certainly would have no hesitation going into battle with him. Which was just as well.  \n\nThe snatching of the Batillus from under Asad's nose had not only made him furious, but at the same time embarrassed. He was trying to grow the I.R.G.C.'s authority in his country and this had certainly been a retrograde step.\nIn response, Asad wanted to make some quick retaliatory high impact scores against the Task Force. As an ex-pilot this was going to take the form of a series of air attacks. \n\nIntel had learned that he was organising for his air power on the coast to be significantly increased, as a prelude to a major strike. Eight Mig29A's had landed late last night at Bandar Abbas Air Base and a further four at Bandar Lengeh. The Task Force command was intent on stopping this before it started.

You and Matrix, Ford Group, have the more challenging target of Bandar Abbas. Your last words to Matrix had been, \"Keep low, I mean bloody low this one's got to be a surprise\" . . . and so it has. \n\n\nTo complete this mission, you will need to be able to take off from the ABE by night with good visibility /\nOperate Radar, Data Link and SA page / Operate TGP / Use weapons on board / Use radio to communicate with ABE and Texaco / Use Tacan to locate Texaco and ABE / carry out successfully air to air refuel (Mission requirement) / Carry out Case 1 or 3 approach and landing as instructed.\n\n\nCOMMS\n\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 Pri Channel 1  / Tacan 72X / ICSL Channel 11\nTexaco : 316.00 Pri Channel 2 / Tacan 10X\n\n\nTIPS\n\n1.    You may well need to use the Night Vision Goggles. ENSURE YOU REQUEST THEY ARE FITTED BY THE GROUND CREW BEFORE YOU FLY. Otherwise, you will not be able to use them when airborne.\n2.    Use the 'Std Heading' procedure to save time configuring the INS.\n3.    Make sure you activate your data link and SA page for better situational awareness.\n4.    Remember when flying with your wingman, give him time to join you, he could well be catching up from a previous holding orbit. So, CONTROL YOUR SPEED APPROPRIATELY THROUGHOUT THE MISSION.\n5.    Put your TGP on standby, you never know when you might need it.\n6.    The area around Bandar Abbas is heavily protected with multiple SAM sites. IT IS ESSENTIAL YOU REMAIN AT LEAST 24 MILES ALWAYS CLEAR OF THE TARGET WP4. IF YOU ENTER THIS KILL ZONE IT WILL BE AN IMMEDIATE MISSION FAIL\n7.    When using your TGP to view a target point given to you via way points THE IMAGE MAY NOT SHOW ITSELF UNTIL YOU ARE UNDER 50 MILES OR LESS. Moving the TGP around from the given target point before the image becomes clear may confuse your search. Have patience the targeted area will reveal itself as you approach.\n8.    When using the AGM-154C allow for them to initiate in good time before your drop. Also step through each missile in advance selecting 'Target of Opportunity'. (This will save time during drop). \n9.    Joint Refuel: ON THIS MISSION YOU MUST REFUEL BEFORE RTB OTHERWISE MISSION FAIL. (You do not need to fully fill your tanks). Ensure you refuel with tanker using the starboard basket. \"Matrix\" will use the Port side whether you are there or not. Use your wingman's approach as a guide to the correct tanker approach speed. IF YOU ARRIVE AT THE TANKER TOO FAR AHEAD OF YOUR WINGMAN, AND HIS FUEL BASKET ON THE TANKERS PORT SIDE IS NOT ALREADY EXTENDED THEN WAIT, DO NOT MAKE YOUR \"READY PRECONTACT\" RADIO CALL UNTIL IT IS. THIS WILL THEN CORRECTLY ACTIVATE YOUR REFUEL BASKET ON THE STARBOARD SIDE.  CONFIRM WHEN BOTH OF YOU ARE COMPLETE VIA THE F10 MENU.\n10.    You could be given a Case 1 or 3 approach and landing depending on your return time. If case 1 your stack height is 2000 feet. If Case 3 follow instructions.\n11.    When RTB contact the ABE at 50 miles as per procedure. (You may struggle to do this due to the ABE not yet appearing on the DCS radio list. In this case just keep trying until it appears, should be about 32 miles). There could be other aircraft landing when you return so if maintain Case 1 pattern until you are given signal CHARLIE by ABE.\n12.    If given a Case 1 approach, some of the USS Abraham Lincoln's accompanying ships have been laid out to describe the four points of the 5-mile circle which forms the basis of the Case 1 landing procedures. These can be used visually to fly an accurate 5-mile circle\n\nNOTES\n\n1.    Each mission has a kneeboard containing all essential information.\n2.    A lot of the communications are trigger based. Pilots will have to operate the radio for Carrier approaches and aerial refueling.\n3.    You will not be able to locate tankers via Tacan until they have been requested in the mission.

Remember when flying with your wingman, give him time to join you, he could well be catching up from a previous holding orbit. So, CONTROL YOUR SPEED APPROPRIATELY THROUGHOUT THE MISSION.\n7.    Be familiar with the 'switchology' of using the Harpoon with the Sea Radar, also the TGP as any target must be visually identified before engaging and confirmed back to Strike using the F10 menu. SUGGEST USING THE HARPOON 'POP UP' TERMINAL SETTING, WITH THE 'SKIM' SETTING THE MISSILE CAN PASS STRAIGHT OVER THE 'SINKER' IF IT MISSES THE TOWER.\n8.    Ensure you respond to requests to confirm instructions using the F10 Menu. \n9.    Some of the USS Abraham Lincoln's accompanying ships have been laid out to describe the four points of the 5-mile circle adjacent the ABE which forms the basis of the Case 1 landing procedures. These can be used visually to fly an accurate 5-mile circle\n\nNOTES\n\n1.    Each mission has a kneeboard containing all essential information.\n2.

It could be that the Admiral's reputation is founded. With the recent sinking of the two Iranian sinkers confidence in the I.R.G.C. is now diminishing, together with its power within Iran. The final part of the Admirals Four Point Strike Plan is to deal with the Iranian nuclear threat, which after all, was the 'Genesis' of the severe International sanctions.  \n\n\nIntel have discovered that a shipment of critical nuclear parts are being shipped into a port near Bandar Abbas. The port is close by the Havadarya air strip. It is understood a gathering of Iran's leading nuclear scientists are nearby, ready to inspect the parts once they arrive. The shipment is due tonight on a Syrian ship, the \"Souria\".\n \n\nTonight's mission is a bold one and will involve an Arleigh Burke Destroyer. It will route North of Khasab and launch some twelve cruise missiles. They will target all the SAM sites in the region of the operation. Another two F/A-18C groups will attack the Iranian aircraft on the ground, using standoff weapons. Ford Group will then go in and take out the \"Souria\" as it enters the docks. After this, Ford Group are to locate and destroy the gathering of scientists. It is rumoured Asad himself may be there with key I.R.G.C. leaders. The gathering could be in one of several places, and so, Ford Group will have to check each one.

  "\n1.    You and \"Wave\", \"Ford Group\", are about to commence your first formal security patrol. Engine start is at 07:00 then move to the designated CAT and Launch heading to WP 1. Keep at 500 feet until clear of ABE's 7-mile zone. (Maintain heading until radio call).   \"Wave\" will launch first and then join you when  airborne\n2.    When instructed head to WP 2 at Angels 15. You will be passing through Fujairah airports control zone.\n3.    Remain at Angels 15 and continue along designated route.\n4.    Patrol from WP's 4 to 7. Your brief is to look for any suspicious naval movements.\n5.    RTB\n\nJust as the Stennis, the deck of the ABE is a noisy, busy place. As you are cleared to start engines, Springfield, a group of four Hornets, are in the CATs ready. They are headed for a similar patrol, but to the West side of the U.A.E. The tanker Arco is also in the launch sequence, they will hold in the West to refuel Springfield, as required. Wave gives you a boyish grin as his canopy closes. It is a great flying day!\n\nTo complete this mission, you will need to be able to: take off from the ABE by day good conditions / Operate your radar and SA Page / use AIM9X A2A missiles if required / Use the TGP for identification / Use radio to contact the ABE for approach and landing / Use Tacan to locate and set course for the ABE / Be familiar with Case 1 approach and Landing.\n\nEnsure you respond to requests to confirm instructions using the F10 Menu.\n\nCOMMS\n\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 Pri Channel 2  / Tacan 72X / ICSL Channel 11\n\n\nTIPS\n\n1.    When starting, use the \"Std Heading\" button on your HSI to reduce your INS configuration time.\n2.    Make sure you activate your data link and SA page for better situational awareness.\n3.    Remember when flying with your wingman, give him time to join you, he could well be catching up from a previous holding orbit. So, control your speed appropriately throughout the mission.\n4.    Put your TGP on standby, you never know when you might need it.\n5.    When using your TGP to view a target point given to you via coordinates the image may not show itself until you are under 50 miles. Moving the TGP around from the given target point before the image becomes clear will only confuse your search. If clouds obscure your target maneuver the aircraft to suit.\n6.    As per prescribed Case 1 procedures on approach contact the ABE at 50 miles out. Contact details will be relayed via radio and are also on your kneeboard.\n7.    Some of the USS Abraham Lincoln's accompanying ships have been laid out to describe the four points of the 5-mile circle adjacent the ABE which forms the basis of the Case 1 landing procedures. These can be used visually to fly an accurate 5-mile circle\n\n\nNOTES\n\n1.    Each mission has a kneeboard containing all essential information. Call kneeboard and select \"Previous Page\" once.\n2.    A lot of the communications are trigger based. Pilots will have to operate the radio for Carrier approaches and aerial refueling.\n3.    The design of the missions are trigger based and so it is important that you follow the route and any instructions to realise all the content and pass the mission.\n4.

  "AS REQUESTED, THIS VERSION NO LONGER ENFORCES TURBULENCE, SELECT IT IF YOU WISH IN YOUR OWN SETTINGS.\n\nOver the last few weeks, you have both settled into life on the ABE. Things are very much like the Stennis and so you are starting to feel at home. The VFA-113 are a good cohesive group of pilots and you have been quickly accepted into the wing. In fact, both of your aircraft have already been updated with the \"Stingers\" livery. \n\nYou both miss flying through the green landscapes of the Caucuses but are getting used to the wall-to-wall browns and beiges of the desert region. The heat, however, is another issue, there is no doubt this climate is much more challenging than you had thought. It is impossible to close your canopy on deck without the ventilation system fully online.\n\nIt is becoming clear in the Ready Room briefings that CAG, back at the Stennis, had not overplayed the situation down here in the Gulf. The new IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) Leader 'Asad' seems intent on conflict. He has no respect for the size or power of the Allied Forces and will push the High Commands buttons whenever he gets the chance. He is, without a doubt, on a crusade to show his country the IRGC can take control of the Straits. There have been numerous encounters with shipping over the last few weeks. The GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) are getting extremely nervous and looking to the Task Force for security and protection. To this end the Command have organised an ever-increasing number of aerial patrols to ensure their security.\n\n\n" : "按需求，此版本不再强制使用湍流效果，如需请自行在设置中选择。\n\n过去几周，你们已经适应了亚伯拉罕·林肯号上的生活。这里的环境与斯坦尼斯号非常相似，所以你们开始有家的感觉。第113战斗攻击机中队的飞行员们配合默契，你们很快就融入了这个联队。事实上，你们两人的战机都已换上了\"毒刺\"中队涂装。\n\n你们都很怀念在高加索青翠地貌间飞行的日子，但也逐渐习惯了沙漠地区连绵不绝的棕黄色调。然而，炎热则是另一回事——毫无疑问，这里的气候比预想的更具挑战性。在甲板上关闭座舱盖时，必须确保通风系统完全开启。\n\n从待命室的简报中可以清楚看出，斯坦尼斯号上的舰载航空联队指挥官并未夸大海湾地区的局势。新任伊朗革命卫队领袖'阿萨德'似乎执意挑起冲突。他毫不顾忌盟军的规模与实力，一有机会就会试探高层指挥部的底线。毫无疑问，他正致力于向国民证明革命卫队有能力掌控海峡。过去几周已发生多起海上冲突事件，海湾合作委员会愈发紧张，正寻求特遣部队提供安全保障。为此，指挥部已组织日益频繁的空中巡逻以确保区域安全。",

In response they are increasing their anti-submarine defences and patrols.\n\nOn the ground Asad has also been ramping up the 'Boghammer' action in the straits and there have been numerous attempts to board ships and commandeer them. None have taken place yet, but it has been more luck than judgement. In response Command are now instigating a larger number of aerial patrols. These to check shipping in the straits, to keep it safe. These are now taking the form of single aircraft patrols to double the area that can be covered by each wing.\n\n\nThe IRGC are still denying their involvement in any of these actions and blaming insurgents not within their control. The R.O.E. as a result, is still not to open fire, unless fired on. This, the worst of both worlds as far as you are concerned. You would much prefer an action where 'the gloves were off' and at least then, you would know where you stood in an engagement. As a substitute, a 'Show of Force' has been used to dissuade Boghammers.

The reality being that there is large area to cover and the Boghammers are small, fast and numerous.\n\nLast night a new danger raised its head, a merchant ship was damaged by a mine. Luckily, it did not sink, but did result in some oil spillage. The ship is now being towed to harbour for repairs. Command has taken the view that Iran has now made the first strike, and from this point on, the IRGC cannot be allowed to lay any more mines in these busy waters. The 'Rules of Engagement' have now changed. In future, if craft are positively identified as mine layers, they will be dealt with using lethal force. This, to serve as a warning to others. \n\nIntel has confirmed, unsurprisingly, the mines are being laid throughout the night under cover of darkness. They are normally laid by a small cruiser accompanied by one or more Boghammers.

  "\n1.    You are to start engines at 01:30 and head to the CAT as directed. You are then to launch and follow a Case 3 night-time departure protocol. Once clear of ABE you are to head to WP1 at Angels 10. You are to anchor here And Wait until you are joined by Dodge and Uzi.\n2.    Once joined you are to push to WP4 via WP's 2 & 3 at Angels 12. You will be transiting Fujairah's control zone. Between WP 2 and 3 Dodge and Uzi will depart in different directions to commence their patrols in different areas.\n3.    You are to commence your search for mine layers using your Sea Radar/TGP/FLIR along a line between WP4 and 5. Adjust height, as necessary. There will be numerous ships in the area, so you need to identify the mine layers. They comprise a small cruiser with accompanying Boghammers. \n4.    If Minelayers are identified, YOU MUST REPORT TO STRIKE AND AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS USING F10.\n5.    Texaco is in the area for you to plug prior to RTB. This is optional in this mission. \n\nThe weather is good, but YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO RELY ON YOUR TGP AND GOGS LIKE NEVER BEFORE.\n\nTo complete this mission, you will need to be able to: Launch from the Stennis by night good visibility / Use the weapons on board / Use the HSI & SA / Use Radar Sea Mode / Use the TGP FLIR for search / Use the Night Vision Goggles / Use Tacan for location of Texaco and ABE / Use radio to communicate with Texaco and ABE / Carry out A2A refuel at night (Optional this mission)/ make a Case 3 approach and landing on the ABE.\n\nCOMMS\n\nTexaco : 256.00 Pri Channel 1 / Tacan 10X\nUSS Abraham Lincoln : 127.50 Pri Channel 2  / Tacan 72X / ICSL Channel 11\n\nTIPS\n\n1.    You will need to use the Night Vision Goggles for refuel. ENSURE YOU REQUEST THEY ARE FITTED BY THE GROUND CREW BEFORE YOU FLY. Otherwise you will not be able to use them when airborne.\n2.    Use the 'Std Heading' procedure to save time configuring the INS.\n3.    Mine layers, if any, will be between WP 4 and 5 DO NOT WANDER MUCH FROM THIS LINE.\n4.    Since the introduction of the Radar Sea mode the search process for mine layers has become much easier. Set up the Sea Radar and lock up ships. Then by switching to the ATFLIR the ship targeted can be identified quickly. By working through radar ship contacts the mine layers can be quickly located. They are normally a cruiser with some Boghammers in attendance.\n5.    It is critical that any Mine layer located is positively identified by Strike prior to attack. AN ATTACK WITHOUT STRIKE CLEARANCE WILL BE A MISSION FAIL. To make positive ID you will be asked to send an image of the suspected mine layer back to Strike using F10 function. You must be within 2 miles of the mine layer to allow a positive ID. If the mine layer is targeted, you will have a distance read out on your HUD to help assess this. Best to send the image when overhead. NOTE MORE THAN TWO ATTEMPTS TO DO THIS WITHIN THE 2 MILES DISTANCE WILL BE A MISSION FAIL.\n6.    Air to air refueling is optional in the mission.    \n7.    When executing the Case 3 approach the stack will be 21 Miles behind the ABE. This is best located by setting Tacan and entering ships course. \n8.    As part of the Case 3 procedure you will be given a time to commence your approach from the hold. If you decide to commence before this time, to save time, you will still be able to pass this mission. Strict compliance of the commencement time is not a Mission success criterion.\n9.    Ensure you respond to requests to confirm instructions using the F10 Menu. YOU WILL ALWAYS BE ASKED TO CONFIRM VIA THE F10 MENU ON COMPLETION OF A PLUG. IT IS IMPORTANT THIS IS DONE TO PROCEED WITH THE MISSION SUCCESSFULLY.\n\nNOTES\n\n1.    Each mission has a kneeboard containing all essential information. Select Kneeboard and 'Previous page' once.\n2.    You will not be able to locate tankers via Tacan until they have been requested in the mission.

Their leader, Asad, was aware he could not just rely on the Boghammer and mine laying operations, he needed to do more.\n\nAs always happens in these sorts of conflicts, change was afoot. This time much to the embarrassment of the Task Force and Central Command. Two days ago, the \"Batillus\", a French merchant ship was boarded and commandeered by 'Takavar' Special Forces who had been dropped in using Iranian helos. The ship had then been forced to route to the island of Abu Musa where it remains under heavy guard. The I.R.G.C. have made it clear, unless sanctions are lifted, that is where the Batillus will remain. It is clear Asad has now become much more brazen and is no longer denying Iran's responsibility in these matters.\n\nIn response, the Task Force have now stepped up the patrols, and much to your relief, restored two ship flights. It is good to be back flying with 'Wave' your wingman. The team is back together. \n\nYou are preparing for yet another patrol when the ABE receive a distress call from the ship \"Rowan\". There are suspect Helos in the area who are not responding to the Rowans communication attempts. They fear it may be the start of an attempt to board them.

You lower yourself into the Hornet and give a thumbs up to Wave. Uzi and Dodge are already on the CAT's, they are responding to a similar call, this must be a coordinated action. Arco is just starting to taxi. Your heart starts to race as you wonder what you are going to find when you get to the Rowan. Are you going to be too late?\n\nTo complete this mission, you will need to be able to: Launch from ABE in good conditions but low level fog/ Enter 'Precision' co-ordinates when in the air as issued by Strike (see TIPS below) / Use weapons in your load out as directed / Use Tacan to locate Arco and ABE / Use radar, SA page, data Link to locate \"Wave\" / Use radio to contact Arco and ABE /Carry out A2A refuel, not optional./ Carry out Case 3 approach and landing on ABE with low level fog.\n\nEnsure you respond to requests to confirm instructions using the F10 Menu.

(NOTE: You may struggle to do this due to the ABE not yet appearing on the DCS radio list. In this case just keep trying until it appears, should be about 32 miles).\n8.    You will have to carry out a Case 3 approach on your return. To help, a single ship has been provided at the designated hold area for the Case 3 approach. (21 Miles behind the ABE).

It had been a serious blow for Iran, the I.R.G.C. and Asad's authority. No longer could Asad use his propaganda machine to taunt and embarrass the Allied Forces and more importantly the Task Force.\n\nAboard the ABE the atmosphere was much more sombre, the death of your wingman Lt Larry Jackson, \"Wave\", had been a great loss and was felt throughout the crew, and most of all, by yourself. You had sunk into a deep depression over these last couple of weeks. During this time, the CO had made sure you were kept busy, and ensured you were flying regularly. There had also been a lot of support from the Wing. \n\nAt a joint meeting with XO and the CO you were paired up with your new Wingman. Lt Lee Anderson, a Southern boy.

After a few weeks of flying as a pair, it was becoming obvious that you would both make a good team. Although he was not another 'Wave' you certainly would have no hesitation going into battle with him. Which was just as well.  \n\nThe snatching of the Batillus from under Asad's nose had not only made him furious, but at the same time embarrassed. He was trying to grow the I.R.G.C.'s authority in his country and this had certainly been a retrograde step.\nIn response, Asad wanted to make some quick retaliatory high impact scores against the Task Force. As an ex-pilot this was going to take the form of a series of air attacks. \n\nIntel had learned that he was organising for his air power on the coast to be significantly increased, as a prelude to a major strike.

Ford Group will carry out a surprise early morning strike, to take out these aircraft at Bandar Abbas using standoff weapons.
