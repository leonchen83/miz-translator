  "***  BEFORE BEGINNING THE CAMPAIGN, PLEASE READ THE PLAYER GUIDE LOCATED IN THE CAMPAIGN DOCUMENTS FOLDER (DCS INSTALL\\MODS\\CAMPAIGNS\\F16C LAST OUT\\DOC)  ***\n\nIt's been almost 2 weeks since we left H4, and boy am I glad we did.  My name is Captain Dan Wilson, callsign 'Forrest', a USAF pilot with the 79th Fighter Squadron and a Wild Weasel.  Chances are you already know all this but for those that don't please indulge me as I recap how I and my fellow detachment pilots came to find ourselves at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus.\n\nIn late June a 6 aircraft detachment from our squadron was assigned to the Joint Syrian Task Force (JSTF) and deployed to H4 airbase in Jordan, our mission was to provide Wild Weasel support to Operation Cerberus North.  The goal of OCN is to stabilize the screwed up failed state that Syria has become, with a major civil war raging between government forces and the breakaway Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and a violent insurgency in the east of the country by the Syrian Islamic Army (SIA).  OCN has two goals, first establish no fly zones across northern Syria to prevent the Syrians bombing SDF controlled areas and second, to support the SDF and Kurdish YPG in defeating the SIA.  As I write this some 6 weeks later it would be fair to say we've seen some developments.\n\nOur campaign against the SIA started well, our detachment supported a number of missions as the JSTF struck a variety of SIA targets, including infrastructure and leadership targets.  From a Weasel's perspective this was a gentle introduction to the Syrian Theater of Operations, with just a handful of SA-8s and an SA-6 troubling us...threats we made short work of.\n\nIt wasn't long though until the Syrians began attempting to violate the no fly zones.  Supporting the enforcement of these zones was the primary reason for our assignment to Jordan...you see the Syrians had deployed significant air defenses along the southern no fly zone - making it difficult for JSTF aircraft to enter these locations and visually ID the intruders.  Why the need for a visual ID?  Well I should probably say the Russians are active in the theater and providing support to the Syrians, and of course we are not about to enforce a no fly zone on the Russians...so they get a free pass.  \n\nOur role then was to roll back the air defenses from around the no fly zone, allowing the JSTF room to operate.  We were successful in this role, eliminating a number of air defense positions and playing our part in a large coordinated attack against the northern section of the Syrian IADS.  This enabled the JSTF to fully enforce the no fly zones, in turn giving the SDF protection from attack by air (from the Syrians at least).  This ultimately helped the SDF break out from the stalemate they were locked into around Homs and saw them rapidly push south.  They were eventually stopped at the town of Yabrud, around 30 miles north of Damascus.\n\nA new stalemate then emerged at Yabrud, one which the Syrians seemed determined to break at any cost, including the widespread bombardment of civilian areas.  This led to a strong ultimatum from the JSTF to cease deliberate targeting of civilians, it was not heeded and the JSTF carried out a series of major attacks on the Syrians - striking dozens of high value targets around Damascus.  The Weasels were of course heavily involved, flying into the heart of a dense SAM network around Damascus - an experience none of us is ever going to forget.\n\nAs all this was happening the SIA were being driven from their capital city of Raqqa as the SDF and YPG assault neared it's conclusion.  But the SIA is an organization that seems incapable of dying, they may have been forced out of their strongholds but they began to pop up in the expansive and empty desert in eastern Syria.  SIA fighters began to make life at H4 difficult for us, with a rocket attack on the base resulting in no casualties but certainly succeeding in making us stop and think about our security.  The SIA followed this up with an attack on the Jordanian border, just north of H4.  Concerned by a deteriorating security situation the decision was made to pull us out of Jordan and we were relocated to RAF Akrotiri, the Brits agreeing to squeeze us into an already crowded base that already hosted numerous JSTF nations.  \n\nAnd that brings us up to date and explains how I swapped a cramped tent in the desert for a modest room here in Cyprus.  It's still cramped, the base is packed and we're squeezing at least four pilots into every room but I think I speak for all the det when I say it's a major step up from what we had...hell this place has shops, bars, a pool, bowling alley and even a Go Kart track.  It's a long way from the austere environment we had at H4.\n\nSince arriving at Akrotiri we've yet to fly.  After 6 weeks of intensive flying we've been given a little time off to recuperate, and our aircraft maintainers have taken the opportunity to do some much needed work on our jets.  We've enjoyed the time off, and made the most of the base's amenities but we are missing the flying and thus woke this morning excited and ready for the day ahead - our first mission out of Akrotiri.\n\nWe rose early, the dawn sun just beginning to light up the red tiled roof of the apartment building we'd been housed in.  I was bunked with Lt. Ed 'Bug' Donavan, Lt. John 'Rotor' Spiers and Major Tom 'Tank' Porter taking up the other bunk in our room.  We dressed, grabbed coffee from a small but modern kitchenette on our floor and then began the long trek over to the base ops building.  On the way we ran into Captain Kevin 'Ghost' Buster, another of our detachment's pilots.  We arrived together at the ops building, an ugly two story concrete structure near the airbase's control tower.  Inside we reported to one of the secure briefing rooms where a group of personnel were already present and seated in the front row of the blue cushioned theater style seating.  At the front of the room a wooden podium was occupied by a familiar face, our squadron CO Lt. Col Gary 'Popeye' Doyle.  A large, blank projector screen stood empty behind him.\n\nPopeye greeted us all as we entered and gestured for us to sit.\n\n\"Good morning pilots\" he began in his characteristically upbeat demeanor.  \"I hope you've enjoyed your short break here at Akrotiri so far...\" Popeye was met with a series of subtle nods, \"...and I hope you're looking forward to getting back into the air today.  I'm pleased to say the aircraft are looking good, as usual our ground crew have done an outstanding job getting them ready\".\n\nGesturing at a young dark haired British man, Popeye then introduced one of Akrotiri's OMTs (Operational Meteorologist Technician) to brief us on the weather.  August in Cyprus brings excellent weather, which is exactly what we've seen since arriving here 2 weeks ago.  Today will be no different with temperatures around 32 degrees celsius, calm winds and scattered clouds around 6,000 feet MSL.\n\nWith the departure of the OMT Popeye invited Major Norris to speak.  Norris was the air force intelligence officer assigned to our H4 detachment and had relocated with us to Akrotiri.  An energetic and tall Texan, Norris always spoke with enthusiasm.\n\n\"Morning everyone\" he began as he bounded to the podium, \"As you know it's been almost 2 weeks since Operation Dominant Enforcer and the JSTF attacks on the Damascus area.  These attacks were successful and have had an impact on the Syrian warfighting capability\".\n\n\"They were not, however, a knockout blow.  The Syrian's are certainly fighting less effectively, with widespread shortages in ammunition, manpower and equipment...but they are still fighting.  The frontline between the Syrians and the SDF remains pretty much where we left it, with the focal point of the fighting continuing at Yabrud\".\n\nNorris clicked a new chart onto the screen at the front of the room.\n\n\"The fighting at Yabrud shows no sign of abating, and while the Syrians might be suffering a loss of effectiveness, they're certainly trying to make up for it with an increased appetite for destruction. Assessments are that the stalemate at Yabrud looks set to continue a while longer, at great cost to both sides.  Further north, Shayrat and Tiyas air bases remain under Syrian control, but are cut off and remain operationally ineffective\".\n\n\"Moving south to Damascus we've seen more uprisings take place around the capital, believed to be fuelled by the ever growing discontent the local population has about the way the government is treating it's own population, especially in Sunni areas\".\n\nTank spoke up at this point and asked, \"Major, are we still seeing the same number of defections within the SAA in addition to the uprisings?\"\n\nNorris responded, \"Not that we're aware of, but the SAA has already seen very large numbers defecting to the SDF, speculation is that most of those who can or will defect have done so already...but that is just speculation at this point.  We'll update you all if we get more information in the future\".\n\n\"Now let's move on to the Russians...\"\n\nA collective sigh was let out across the briefing room and was met by a rue smile from Major Norris.\n\n\"I know, I know...the Russians are being a real pain in the ass out here.\"\n\n\"Try highly unprofessional!\" Rotor exclaimed.\n\n\"More like downright dangerous!\" Bug responded, \"They're gonna get someone killed if they keep behaving like they have been.\"\n\nJust as I was about to open my mouth, Popeye interjected and cut me off.\n\n\"Ok, ok calm down, the Major is well aware of the Russian behavior in Syria...more so than any of you I'm willing to bet, so let's cool it and let him speak\".\n\nAs the room quieted down, Major Norris continued.\n\n\"As I was saying, Russian airstrikes against the SDF are continuing, and as you all just pointed out we are seeing a worrying number of incidents where Russian pilots are flying in an aggressive manner and harassing our aircraft in theater.  No doubt looking to distract us and deter us from our mission here\".  \n\n\"And passing intel to the Syrians\" remarked Rotor.\n\n\"Yes most probably\" conceded Norris, \"And I'm sure you remember that Russian AWACS is now also operating in theater as well, although their command and control abilities are not anywhere near as sophisticated as our own\".\n\nSwitching the slides on the screen Norris continued,  \"We are also tracking a surface group from the Russian Navy, which has entered the Mediterranean and is currently around 50 nm southwest of Cyprus.  This group consists of two Ropucha class landing ships, the frigate Neustrashimy and the Kirov class battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy\". \n\n\"Sounds like they really mean business\" Popeye remarked, \"What's the potential cargo on the landing ships?\"\n\nNorris replied, \"We're unsure of the exact cargo, but a ship like this is designed for roll on, roll off cargo so potentially dozens of armored vehicles, or possibly substantial supplies and ammo for the Syrians\". \n\n\"How about mobile SAMs?\" asked Ghost.\n\n\"Potentially\" replied Norris, \"We will monitor the ships as they dock and update you accordingly, and I'm sure I don't need to tell you this but do not approach these ships.  The Russians have been quite aggressive in keeping snooping eyes away.  Finally, we've also seen an increase in Russian bombers in the region, with both Bears and Blackjacks entering Syrian airspace over the last week.  So in summary, Russian resolve to continue supporting Syria appears to remain very strong and they will be a significant continuing presence in Syria for the foreseeable future\".\n\n\"Moving away from the Russians, the SIA are on the verge of defeat in Raqqa, with victory expected to be declared within days.  However victory in Raqqa and victory over the SIA are two different things.  The conventional threat from the SIA as a military force is all but spent, but as an asymmetric threat the SIA are likely to give us all headaches in theater going forwards.  Reports of minor SIA attacks are widespread across eastern Syria and even in the suburbs of Damascus.  These attacks are mostly confined to either small groups of dismounts with small arms or technicals.  We believe the SIA are pretty much out of operational heavy equipment at this stage\".\n\n\"Finally let's look at Hezbollah, they are continuing to operate drones over the Lebanese border, which we believe are continuing to support Syrian targeting of SDF movements down the Homs to Yabrud road.  There are also indications of widespread Hezbollah activity in the border area, potentially a precursor to a more direct involvement by Hezbollah in the conflict\".\n\nNorris' briefing ended, and Popeye thanked him as he left the briefing room.  Settling back into position behind the podium Popeye began to speak." : "*** 开始战役前，请阅读位于战役文档文件夹中的玩家指南(DCS安装目录\\MODS\\CAMPAIGNS\\F16C LAST OUT\\DOC)  ***\n\n离开H4基地已近两周，说真的我很庆幸这次转移。我是美国空军第79战斗机中队\"野鼬鼠\"飞行员丹·威尔逊上尉，呼号\"Forrest\"。虽然各位可能已经知道，但请允许我简要回顾我们这支分遣队是如何来到塞浦路斯的Akrotiri皇家空军基地的。\n\n六月底，我们中队六架战机被编入叙利亚联合特遣队(JSTF)，部署到约旦H4空军基地，为\"北域守护者行动\"(OCN)提供野鼬鼠支援。OCN旨在稳定叙利亚这个陷入内战泥潭的失败国家——政府军与分裂的叙利亚民主军(SDF)激烈交战，而叙利亚伊斯兰军(SIA)则在东部发动叛乱。我们的首要任务是建立禁飞区阻止叙军空袭SDF控制区，其次支持SDF和库尔德YPG打击SIA。如今六周过去，局势已发生显著变化。\n\n初期对SIA的打击很顺利，我们支援了多轮针对其基础设施和指挥系统的空袭。对我们野鼬鼠而言，叙利亚战场的开局相当温和，仅遭遇少量SA-8和SA-6的威胁，都被轻松解决。\n\n但叙军很快开始试探禁飞区边界。我们部署约旦的主要任务就是压制其南部禁飞区沿线密集的防空网，为JSTF识别入侵者创造行动空间——由于俄军也在该区域活动，我们必须目视识别以免误判。通过一系列协同打击，我们成功削弱了叙军综合防空系统(IADS)，使SDF得以打破霍姆斯僵局向南推进，最终在距大马士革30英里的Yabrud受阻。\n\nYabrud形成新对峙后，叙军不惜炮击平民区试图破局。在JSTF最后通牒被无视后，我们发动了针对大马士革周边高价值目标的大规模打击。作为野鼬鼠，我们深入大马士革密集防空网的经历令人终生难忘。\n\n与此同时，SDF即将攻陷SIA\"首都\"拉卡。但残部开始在东部的沙漠地带流窜，甚至袭击了H4基地和约旦边境。鉴于安全形势恶化，我们被转移至拥挤但设施完善的Akrotiri基地——这里有商店、酒吧、泳池甚至卡丁车道，与H4的艰苦环境天壤之别。\n\n抵达两周来我们首次恢复飞行。清晨曙光中，我同室友\"Bug\"多纳文中尉、\"Rotor\"斯皮尔斯中尉和\"Tank\"波特少校穿过基地，在作战简报室见到了中队长\"Popeye\"多伊尔中校。气象简报显示塞浦路斯八月典型的晴朗天气：32摄氏度，微风，6000英尺散云。\n\n情报官诺里斯少校更新了战场态势：虽然JSTF对大马士革的\"主导执法行动\"重创了叙军战力，但Yabrud的血腥僵局仍在持续。叙军控制下的Shayrat和Tiyas空军基地已被孤立。大马士革周边 Sunni 聚居区的反政府起义持续发酵，不过叙政府军(SAA)叛逃潮已趋缓。\n\n提到俄军时简报室一片哗然。\"简直是职业素养灾难！\"Rotor喊道。\"他们再这样挑衅迟早会闹出人命，\"Bug补充。Popeye平息骚动后，诺里斯继续通报：俄军持续空袭SDF，其AWACS和海军编队(包括基洛夫级\"彼得大帝号\")已抵近塞浦路斯西南50海里处，两艘蟾蜍级登陆舰可能运送装甲车辆或防空系统。\"绝对不要接近，\"诺里斯警告，\"俄军对侦察行为异常敏感。\"\n\nSIA在拉卡的溃败已成定局，但其化整为零的袭扰已蔓延至大马士革郊区。最后诺里斯指出，黎巴嫩边境的真主党无人机频繁为叙军提供SDF动向，其武装人员也可能直接介入冲突。\n\n简报结束后，Popeye走向讲台：\"今天我们将重返叙利亚空域执行任务...\"",
  "\"Ok then let's get back to business.  First a squadron update for you, I'm pleased to say our numbers here on Operation Cerberus North are being boosted.  Our hosts have agreed to squeeze a couple of extra Vipers here on base so tomorrow we'll see both Boomer and Shade fly out and join us....\"\n\nA series of low groans and mutters interrupted Popeye, a stern glance down at each of us quickly silenced them.\n\n\"...as I was saying, Boomer and Shade will be joining us so I'm sure you'll all be glad of the extra support\".\n\nBug muttered under his breath at a level low enough not to be heard by Popeye but I caught exactly what he said... \"Oh man, anyone but that dick\".  I knew he was referring to Shade, a senior squadron figure who was not popular with almost anyone in the squadron.  I gave Bug a quick dig in the ribs to silence him, this wasn't the time or place.\n\nPopeye continued, \"Moving on to today's missions.  Since Operation Dominant Enforcer the JSTF has backed off a little while we monitor the impact our strikes had on the Syrians.  So the ATO has been all no fly zone patrols and recon in low threat areas, which is why we've been afforded some time off\".\n\n\"Today the ATO is pretty much the same, but this time at least we're back on it.  This afternoon we'll be taking up 3 separate two ships to carry out Weasel patrols of the no fly zones.  Pairs will be myself and Rotor, Forrest and Bug and Tank and Ghost.  Our patrols will be in support of a series of photo reconnaissance flights over the SDF and SAA frontline.  The recon flights will be carried out by the detachment of French Mirage F1s stationed here at Akrotiri\".\n\n\"Our role will of course be to provide protection to the Mirages should they come under SAM threat during their mission, we will also be available to provide cover against air to air threats should this be required\".\n\n\"Sir, what's the current level of SAM threat?\" asked Bug.\n\n\"Our Rivet Joint flights are indicating sporadic SA-6 and SA-8 indications at the forward edge of Syrian territory.  All current intel points to a few surviving mobile SAMs in this region, however the Syrians appear reluctant to turn them on for long...I think they worked out what happens when they do\".\n\n\"Learned the hard way,\" Rotor declared grinning.\n\n\"Indeed they have,\" Popeye responded, \"So let's make sure we remind them of those lessons should they attempt to get involved in the mission today, but don't get complacent.  Intel may assess a low threat level around the FEBA, but we know from experience how many SAMs the Syrians have stashed away around Damascus...and most of them highly mobile so stay alert at all times\".\n\n\"Copy boss,\" Rotor replied.\n\nPopeye continued, \"And remember that Palmyra airbase is still fully operational, with an active SA-6\".\n\n\"Maybe one day they'll finally let us take it out\", Tank commented., referring to the fact that the Syrians were using important historical ruins as cover for their forces around Palmyra.\n\nPopeye then moved on to brief each flight plan in more detail.\n\nMy flight will be operating under the callsign Sword 2, we will be flying the second patrol of the day, in support of the recon flight Mastiff 3.\n\nPopeye was keen to stress that we should all be familiar with the SPINS here at Akrotiri and encouraged us to take one last look at them before we step to the jets.  The Akrotiri airspace can be very busy given the proximity to major commercial air routes into Cyprus so it is really important we fully understand the procedures out here.\n\nUpon takeoff it is vital we maintain our runway heading until we are feet wet and clear of the Akrotiri peninsula - there are obstacles both north and south of the runway heading.\n\nAs we get airborne we will contact Akrotiri Departure, who will vector us to one of Akrotiri's three navigation points; Mezus, Anane or Irefa.  Upon our arrival at the relevant nav point (waypoints 1-3), Akrotiri will hand us off to the theater ABCCC 'Sentinel' for command and control.  We will check in with Sentinel for a mission update before proceeding on mission to waypoint 4.\n\nWe will rendezvous with Mastiff 3 at waypoint 4, before proceeding through waypoint 5 and into the 'Silver Corridor', an authorized route into Syria through Lebanon that has been negotiated with the Lebanese Government.  We must not deviate from our assigned course through the Silver Corridor as the Russian naval base at Tartus lies just 15nm north and the Lebanese have not cleared us to fly anywhere other then the designated airspace.  It is also important we maintain our assigned altitude due to the potential threat from Hezbollah forces at lower levels.\n\nOnce clear of the Silver Corridor at waypoint 6, we will fence in and begin our patrol, mirroring the route of Mastiff 3.  We will track west to east from waypoints 7 to 8, before turning south for waypoint 9 while ensuring we keep clear of the SA-6 MEZ at Palmyra.  We will then push back west from waypoint 9 to waypoint 10,  During the east to west track Mastiff will be operating over the FEBA between the SDF and SAA and will be at their most vulnerable.  At this point I should be ready to react with HARMS should they come under threat.\n\nOnce Mastiff are clear of the threat area at waypoint 10, we will contact Sentinel for clearance back into Silver and push back through waypoints 6 and 5 into the Mediterranean.  Once clear of Silver we will proceed back towards Akrotiri, contacting Akrotiri Approach 50nm out from the base.  Akrotiri Approach will then direct us back to either Mezus, Anane or Irefa.  Once at the assigned nav point we will fly either the Mezus Star, Anane Star or Irefa Star tracks (see SPINS) to the 14nm arc from Akrotiri.  We will follow the 14nm arc to the 106 radial for Akrotiri (point Star), at which point Akrotiri Approach will either instruct us to enter the traffic pattern or clear us to descend to our initial point for the assigned runway.  Once at our initial point we will contact Akrotiri Tower for landing clearance, as we land we should again observe the base's procedures on minimum altitudes and restricted areas outlined in the SPINS.\n\nLoadout today will be two HARMS for myself for SAM suppression, Bug will be carrying two GBU-38s in case we need to precisely target specific threats.  We will both also be hauling AIM-120s, AIM-9Xs (available for us at last!), two external tanks and the ECM, TGP and HTS pods.  Bingo from the furthest point of our flight plan is 5,500 lb.\n\nPopeye also had a few other important points to emphasize.  Friendly SDF forces are deployed in the areas around both Shayrat and Tiyas as they press their attacks so we should avoid engaging targets at these bases to avoid the risk of hitting friendly units.  There should be no significant threats present at these bases as all major SAM systems have been put out of action and only SHORAD remains.\n\nThe Mirage F1s we are escorting are from an older generation of aircraft, lacking both data link and TACAN so this will make it harder to monitor their position as we support them with our patrol.  It will be important that we pay attention to our flight plan and speeds to ensure we remain in a position to assist them if required.\n\nPalmyra airbase is a controversial target, still left untouched despite all nearby bases having been attacked heavily.  This is down to two reasons; the chemical weapons bunkers located near the base, and the culturally significant ruins and UNESCO world heritage site in close proximity.  Collateral damage to either are totally unacceptable to the JSTF, and so we are not currently permitted to fire on targets in this area unless there is an imminent danger to life.  This means the SA-6 at Palmyra finds itself the luckiest SAM around and keeps surviving to fight another day.  Should we get fired upon by this SAM we can return fire with HARMS if the situation warrants, but we should be prepared to justify our actions when we get back should that happen.  But as Popeye stressed, we should not be in it's MEZ to start with and instead should be paying close attention to our position.\n\nWe ended the briefing discussing the threats.  All known SAM positions in the vicinity of the no fly zone have been destroyed (except Palmyra), however there is still a threat from the ample supply of mobile SAM systems the Syrians still have stashed around the country.  We should be alert to the presence of these around the frontline areas (the southern portion of Mastiff's route).  These are most likely to be SA-6s or SA-8s, but we have seen SA-11s in use several times by the Syrians and we know the Russians have been attempting to resupply these so we should be prepared.  As always we should expect SHORAD around Syrian bases and positions, with our experience in Syria so far telling us this will probably be a mix of low, medium and high altitude AAA, plus MANPADS, SA-9, SA-13 and SA-8.  Syrian air isn't expected to get involved today, based on their usual reluctance to go head to head with us, but we should be prepared in case they change their behavior.  Most likely threats are Mig-21, Mig-23 and Mig-29.\n\nWith the threat brief complete, Popeye asked for questions, and Tank spoke up.\n\n\"What about Russian involvement?\"  he asked, \"Any guidance if they attempt to interfere with our missions?\"\n\n\"Ignore them,\" replied Popeye, \"Don't let them get in your head, they're still trying to distract us, put us off our game and at times downright intimidate us.  Keep your focus on the mission and let them play their games on their own\".\n\nWith that the brief was over.  As we left the briefing room, Bug, Rotor and myself discussed the reinforcements that were coming to join us. \n\nThe arrival of Lt. Glenn Robinson aka 'Boomer' was good news, he's a lively and outgoing Marine on exchange with the air force and was a lot of fun to have around...in addition to being a decent stick.\n\nMajor Eric Malik, callsign 'Shade' was another matter however.  Shade has a huge ego, lacks respect for fellow pilots and despite (in our opinions) questionable talent has seemed to continue advancing his career.  No one likes flying with him and we all hated the debrief with him even more as more often than not he would try and make us carry the weight for anything and everything that went wrong.\n\nBut there was nothing we could do about any of that, so we re-focused on preparing for the mission and making sure we brought Mastiff safely home again.  Take off is 10:20 Zulu, 13:20 local...nice way to spend a summer's afternoon.\n\n" : "\"好，言归正传。首先通报中队近况——我很高兴地宣布'刻耳柏洛斯北方行动'的作战力量将得到增强。驻军基地同意额外部署两架毒蛇战机，明天Boomer和Shade就会飞抵加入我们......\"\n\n一连串低声的抱怨打断了Popeye的发言，他用严厉的目光扫视众人，窃窃私语立刻平息。\n\n\"......正如我刚才所说，Boomer和Shade即将加入，相信诸位都会欢迎增援力量。\"\n\nBug用Popeye听不见的音量嘟囔着，但我听得一清二楚：\"天啊，换谁都行，别是那个混蛋。\"我知道他在说Shade——这位资深飞行员在队内几乎人缘尽失。我用手肘捅了捅Bug示意他闭嘴，现在不是抱怨的时候。\n\nPopeye继续道：\"关于今日任务安排。自从'主宰执行者行动'后，联合特遣部队暂时后撤以评估对叙利亚的打击效果。因此空中任务指令全是禁飞区巡逻和低威胁区侦察，这也是我们能休整的原因。\"\n\n\"今天任务大同小异，但至少我们重返岗位。下午将派出三组双机编队执行禁飞区的野鼬鼠巡逻：我和Rotor、Forrest与Bug、Tank和Ghost三组。任务是掩护法国幻影F1战机对叙利亚民主军与政府军前线实施照相侦察，这些F1来自Akrotiri基地的法国分遣队。\"\n\n\"我们的职责是当幻影遭遇地空导弹威胁时提供保护，必要时还需应对空中威胁。\"\n\n\"长官，当前地空导弹威胁等级如何？\"Bug提问。\n\n\"铆钉接头侦察显示叙利亚边境前沿偶有SA-6和SA-8活动迹象。所有情报表明该区域仅存少量机动防空系统，但叙军似乎不敢长时间开机......我想他们已吸取教训。\"\n\n\"血的教训。\"Rotor咧嘴笑道。\n\n\"确实，\"Popeye点头，\"所以若他们今天胆敢干扰任务，就让他们重温教训——但别掉以轻心。情报评估前线交战区威胁等级低，可我们都知道大马士革周边藏着多少机动防空系统......务必保持警惕。\"\n\n\"明白，头儿。\"Rotor回应。\n\nPopeye补充道：\"别忘了Palmyra空军基地仍全面运作，配备活跃的SA-6系统。\"\n\n\"但愿哪天能端掉它。\"Tank评论道，暗指叙军利用重要历史遗迹作为军事掩护。\n\n随后Popeye详细讲解各编队飞行计划。\n\n我所在的Sword 2编队将执行当日第二次巡逻，掩护代号Mastiff 3的侦察机。Popeye强调必须熟悉Akrotiri的特殊指令（SPINS），建议登机前再温习。由于靠近塞浦路斯商业航线，该空域异常繁忙，必须严格遵守规程。\n\n起飞后需保持跑道航向直至飞越半岛——跑道南北两侧均有障碍物。升空后联系Akrotiri离场管制，将被引导至Mezus、Anane或Irefa三个导航点之一。抵达相应航点（1-3号）后，由战区空中作战指挥控制中心'Sentinel'接管。在向Sentinel确认任务更新后，继续飞往4号航点。\n\n我们将在4号航点与Mastiff 3汇合，经5号航点进入\"Silver走廊\"——这是与黎巴嫩政府协商的叙利亚入境通道。必须严格保持航线，因塔尔图斯俄军基地仅在北侧15海里处，且黎方仅批准特定空域飞行。同时需保持规定高度以防真主党低空威胁。\n\n飞抵6号航点离开Silver走廊后，开始沿Mastiff 3路线巡逻。自7号至8号航点由西向东飞行，随后转向南飞往9号航点，注意规避PalmyraSA-6杀伤区。接着从9号返回10号航点向西飞行——此阶段Mastiff将在前线交战区执行最危险的侦察，我需随时准备用HARM导弹反击威胁。\n\nMastiff脱离威胁区后，联系Sentinel申请重返Silver走廊，经6号、5号航点返回地中海。脱离走廊后联系50海里外的Akrotiri进场管制，按指示飞往指定导航点，执行相应星形进场程序（详见SPINS）。沿14海里弧线飞至106径向线（Star点）后，进场管制将引导加入起落航线或下降至跑道初始点。降落前需联系塔台，并遵守SPINS中关于最低高度和限制区的规定。\n\n今日挂载：我携带两枚HARM反辐射导弹负责防空压制，Bug挂载两枚GBU-38精确制导炸弹应对特定目标。双方均配备AIM-120、AIM-9X导弹（终于配发了！）、两个副油箱以及ECM电子对抗、TGP瞄准吊舱和HTS系统。任务最远点备降油量为5500磅。\n\nPopeye特别强调：友军叙利亚民主军正在夏伊拉特和提亚斯周边推进攻势，应避免攻击这些基地以防误伤。这些基地仅存短程防空系统，主要防空力量已被摧毁。\n\n护航的幻影F1属老式机型，既无数据链也无战术空中导航系统，需严格把控航速航向以确保支援到位。\n\nPalmyra基地仍是敏感目标——尽管周边基地遭重创，但因附近化武仓库和联合国教科文组织世界遗产而免于打击。除非面临致命威胁，否则禁止攻击该区域目标。这意味着Palmyra的SA-6得以幸存。若遭其攻击可酌情用HARM还击，但必须做好返航后解释准备。不过Popeye强调——我们根本不该进入其杀伤区。\n\n威胁简报显示：禁飞区周边已知防空阵地均已摧毁（Palmyra除外），但需警惕叙军遍布全国的机动防空系统，尤其前线区域（Mastiff航线南段）。可能遭遇SA-6/SA-8，也不排除俄军补充的SA-11。各基地周边预计有高/中/低空炮阵、单兵防空导弹及SA-9/SA-13/SA-8。虽然叙空军通常避免正面交锋，仍需防范米格-21/23/29的可能拦截。\n\n简报尾声，Tank提问俄军干预的应对方案。\n\n\"无视他们，\"Popeye回答，\"别被干扰。他们不过是想打乱我们节奏，有时甚至蓄意恐吓。专注任务，让他们自娱自乐。\"\n\n简报结束后，我、Bug和Rotor讨论即将到来的增援。海军陆战队交换飞行员\"Boomer\"Glenn Robinson中尉性格开朗且技术过硬，深受欢迎；但代号\"Shade\"的Eric Malik少校则因狂妄自大、推诿责任而遭人厌弃。不过眼下我们只能专注于13:20（当地时间）起飞的任务，确保Mastiff侦察机安全返航——这将是消磨夏日午后的绝佳方式。",

  "It was a big day today.  I led a large strike package through Israel and into Syria to attack an SA-10 site south of Damascus.  The attack was a low level pop up attack right into the heart of a dense area of SAMs, not the most straightforward thing I've ever had to do and we had to fight our way out of the target...but we survived.  Coming in through Israel was an interesting experience, we had to be careful not to enter the Golan Heights where tensions are extremely high and the Israeli air defenses are on high alert.  Even re-entering Israeli airspace involved following agreed altitudes to ensure the Israelis didn't shoot us down as we did so.  So with that mission complete I was looking forward to a quiet evening back on base.  No such luck and after landing and the debrief we were pretty much dragged straight back into another briefing.  Things are pretty fast paced right now.\n\nAnd so we found ourselves in a late evening briefing, the full detachment was already assembled, all of us having had a quick turnaround from our previous missions.  Once we were all seated Popeye had our OMT begin the met brief for tomorrow.\n\nTomorrow's weather will see a slight deterioration from the conditions today, with the clouds and wind building throughout the night.  We can expect scattered to broken clouds at around 9-10 thousand feet with winds increasing to around 10-15 knots at ground level.\n\nOnce the OMT had delivered their brief and departed, it was time for Major Norris to brief us with an intel update.  The major began by filling us in on an operation that we partially witnessed as we came into land, the chasing off of what was believed to be a Russian intelligence gathering ship parked off the coast near nav point Irefa.  Norris told us that suspicions had grown at how long that ship had remained in the area and eventually someone worked out that it was providing intelligence on our movements in and out of Akrotiri and no doubt passing information on to the Syrians.  The Royal Navy and Marines went out to move them on, and after a tense standoff the ship withdrew peacefully.  A good conclusion but it hasn't helped our already strained Russian relations.\n\nContinuing to discuss the situation in Syria, Norris told us the Russian support for Syria remains unabated, with a fresh round of airstrikes on SDF targets carried out today.  He also revealed another Russian resupply effort appears to be taking place, with flights arriving into several Syrian airbases this afternoon, \"More on that later'', Popeye declared ominously. \n\nShade asked Norris about how the Russians were behaving after yesterday's incident, Major Norris responded by telling us that we'd seen a big drop off in Russian intercepts of our aircraft and less harassment overall.   Let's hope it continues.\n\nTurning to the SDF and SAA frontline, Norris told us that the recent pressure on the Syrians and Hezbollah from JSTF strikes had taken it's toll and the SDF has made a small breakthrough in the Syrian lines.  The frontline now sits just 20 miles north of Damascus.  This got me thinking \"maybe this thing will soon be over\", but Norris' next piece of information, that large amounts of Hezbollah fighters are believed to be massing south of Damascus gave me additional pause for thought.\n\nNorris wrapped up his intel brief with new information on SIA activity, telling us that there were reports of SIA forces popping up in a town in southern Syria.  It is also believed they have made a rocket attack against Israeli forces in the Golan Heights, but this is breaking news and the details are still being verified.  If true however, it's not a good sign as southern Syria is already heating up a lot.\n\nNorris then left the briefing room and Popeye began to brief our mission.\n" : "今天是重要的一天。我率领大型打击编队穿越以色列进入叙利亚，攻击大马士革南部的SA-10防空阵地。这次低空突袭直插萨姆导弹密集区域的核心地带，绝非易事，我们不得不在撤离时边打边撤...但最终全员生还。借道以色列领空是段特殊经历——我们必须谨慎避开戈兰高地，该地区局势高度紧张且以色列防空系统处于戒备状态。就连重新进入以色列空域时，也必须遵守约定高度以免遭误击。完成这项任务后，我正期待着回基地享受宁静夜晚，不料刚结束任务简报就被直接拖进新的任务部署会，当前节奏确实紧张。\n\n深夜简报室里，全体作战分队已集结完毕，所有人都刚从上次任务快速转换状态。待众人就座后，\"水手\"让气象官开始明日天气简报：预计云量和风力将逐渐增强，9000-10000英尺高度出现碎云，地面风速增至10-15节。\n\n气象简报结束后，诺里斯少校带来情报更新。他首先通报了我们着陆时目睹的部分行动——驱离停泊在伊雷法导航点附近海域的俄军侦察船。该船长期滞留引起怀疑，最终被确认在搜集Akrotiri基地的航空动态并传递给叙利亚方面。英国皇家海军陆战队经过紧张对峙后将其劝离，虽和平解决但加剧了本就紧张的俄英关系。\n\n谈及叙利亚局势，诺里斯指出俄军继续全力支持叙政府军，今日又对SDF目标实施新一轮空袭。他透露俄军运输机下午密集降落多个叙利亚空军基地，\"后续还有情况\"，\"水手\"意味深长地补充道。\"暗影\"询问昨日事件后俄方反应，少校表示俄军拦截我机的频次显著下降，整体骚扰行为减少，希望这种态势能持续。\n\n关于SDF与叙政府军前线，联合特遣部队的持续打击显著削弱了叙军和真主党武装，SDF在战线取得小幅突破，目前距大马士革仅20英里。正当我思索\"或许冲突即将结束\"时，少校后续情报显示大量真主党战士正在大马士革以南集结，这又让我陷入沉思。\n\n诺里斯最后通报了SIA的新动态：有报告称该组织人员出现在叙利亚南部城镇，并疑似向戈兰高地以军发动火箭弹袭击（细节尚待核实）。若属实将加剧本已紧张的叙利亚南部局势。情报简报结束后，\"水手\"开始部署作战任务。",

  "\"Ok pilots let's get down to business.\"  Popeye said as he clicked a slide onto the briefing screen.\n\n\"Now as Major Norris already told us, the Russians are in the process of another round of resupply efforts.  Multiple flights of Russian heavy lift aircraft have been observed flying into a number of Syrian bases, including here at Mezzeh where we've identified both armor and large amounts of ammunition and weapons being delivered.  No doubt this equipment is destined for the Syrian frontline, and given the small breakthrough the SDF have just made the CAOC wishes for this to be prevented\".\n\n\"Therefore a number of strikes will be carried out early tomorrow morning, targeting Mezzeh and Marj Ruhayyil airbases and Damascus IAP, the objective of which will be the destruction of these new stockpiles\".\n\n\"Bold move\" remarked Tank, \"Is there not concern that we're going to catch Russians in these attacks?\"\n\n\"Absolutely, it's a good question.\"  Popeye replied, \"First the attacks will be on Syrian storage areas, not Russian transports.  Secondly, command is giving the Russians a short amount of notice of the attacks to ensure they have time to get their personnel clear if they are still present\".\n\n\"Great!\" replied Rotor, \"I'm sure they won't tell the Syrians that we're coming\".\n\n\"But preferable to bombing the Russians\" I added, \"Especially in light of recent events\".  \n\n\"Exactly\" responded Popoeye.  \"It's a complication for sure, but we're used to complications by now so I know you'll handle it.  We will be providing a Weasel two-ship as part of the force protection for each of these strikes, accompanied by EW flights of Growlers and Eagles on CAP\".\n\n\"The threat picture looks complex.  Following the recent Israeli actions in southern Syria and Lebanon, the Syrian air defenses in the area are likely to be primed and ready for anything\".\n\nPopeye continued the briefing, outlining the strike each Weasel flight would be covering, eventually turning to my flight.\n\n\"Forrest, you will be paired with Rotor as Sword 2, you will be covering a strike on Mezzeh airbase, the package has a TOT of 03:55 zulu\".\n\n\"Don't get me killed Forrest,\" Rotor said half joking, but as we expect this to be his last flight before leaving for his new assignment I think he makes a good point.\n\nOnce Popeye had finished briefing the overview of our missions we broke away to begin detailed mission planning.\n\nOur mission will be to provide a lane SEAD operation, covering a strike on Mezzeh airbase by a flight of Strike Eagles (Hammer 2) and two flights of Hornets (Knight 1 and Knight 2).\n\nDeparting Akrotiri, Rotor and I will proceed on flight plan through the Silver Corridor before turning south into the Bekaa Valley at waypoint 6.  We will continue through the valley to waypoint 8, which marks the beginning of our AOR.  Our TOT for waypoint 8 is 03:40 zulu.\n\nThe lane we've been assigned runs from waypoint 8 to waypoint 10, with waypoint 9 located on Mezzeh itself.  We should patrol this lane during our vul time of 03:40Z to 04:00Z, ensuring the suppression or destruction of all threats during this window, as ever the destruction of a threat is preferable to suppression to prevent it attempting to re-engage us at a later time.  The strikers have a TOT of 03:55Z.\n\nThis area of Syria will be heavily defended.  Mezzeh itself has an SA-2 and SA-3 combination protecting it, these are the only known static SAM positions in the area.  We can however guarantee a variety of mobile threats in our assigned lane due to both the threat to Syria of Israel from the south and the presence of a large number of SAA bases in our lane.  EW support will be provided by Spartan 3, who will set up a jamming orbit north of Damascus.\n\nAs in our previous mission we must make sure we keep well clear of the Golan Heights area.\n\nOnce the strikers have egressed our AOR we will proceed back to our rally point at waypoint 11 before pushing back through the Bekaa valley towards home.  Although recent missions have reduced the threat in the Bekaa we should be mindful that this is still Syrian controlled territory.\n\nStocks of Mavericks are running low so I will be loaded out with 4 GBU-38s on this mission, alongside all the usual kit.  Rotor will be carrying 4 HARMs, an indication of just how busy we expect to be.  Bingo fuel is 3,600 lb.\n\nExpected threat systems are the full range of AAA calibers and a wide variety of SAMs; SA-2, SA-3, SA-6, SA-8, SA-9, SA-11 and SA-13 being the most likely.  We should be careful about maintaining position in our assigned lane, to the west we have the Golan Heights and to the east is Damascus, along with a number of airbases and significant SHORAD.  Attempts by the Syrian air force to disrupt our attacks remain rare, but should the SyAAF wish to get involved, we will have an F-15C two ship, callsign Renegade 2 on CAP near Damascus.\n\nWith the details hammered out exhaustively, the briefing was then concluded and Rotor and myself retired to get a few hours sleep.  We need it after today and we step early tomorrow, this will be a dawn takeoff.\n\n" : "\"好了飞行员们，我们开始正事吧。\"Popeye点击简报屏幕上的幻灯片说道。\n\n\"正如Norris少校已经告知我们的，俄罗斯人正在进行新一轮补给行动。已观察到多架俄罗斯重型运输机飞往叙利亚多个基地，包括我们确认有装甲车辆及大量弹药武器运抵的Mezzeh基地。这些装备无疑将输送到叙利亚前线，鉴于叙利亚民主军刚取得的小规模突破，联合作战中心希望阻止这一情况。\"\n\n\"为此明晨将实施多轮空袭，目标为Mezzeh、Marj Ruhayyil空军基地和大马士革国际机场，旨在摧毁这些新运抵的物资储备。\"\n\n\"大胆的行动，\"Tank评论道，\"不担心会误伤俄罗斯人吗？\"\n\n\"问得好，\"Popeye回答，\"首先空袭目标是叙利亚仓储区而非俄方运输工具。其次指挥部会提前短暂通知俄方，确保他们有时间撤离人员。\"\n\n\"太棒了！\"Rotor回应，\"我敢保证他们不会通知叙利亚人我们要来。\"\n\n\"但总比轰炸俄罗斯人强，\"我补充道，\"特别是考虑到近期事件。\"\n\n\"没错，\"Popeye说，\"这确实使情况复杂化，但我们都习惯了复杂局面。每支空袭编队将配备由两架野鼬鼠组成的防空压制小组，配合EA-18G电子战机与CAP巡逻的F-15提供支援。\"\n\n\"威胁态势相当复杂。随着以色列近期在叙利亚南部和黎巴嫩的军事行动，该地区叙利亚防空部队很可能处于高度戒备状态。\"\n\nPopeye继续简报各野鼬鼠编队负责的空袭区域，最后转向我们机组。\n\n\"Forrest，你将与Rotor组成Sword2编队，负责Mezzeh基地空袭护航，任务窗口为Zulu时03:55。\"\n\n\"别让我送命啊Forrest，\"Rotor半开玩笑地说。考虑到这是他调任前的最后一次任务，这个提醒很合理。\n\n简报结束后，我们开始详细任务规划。任务是为攻击Mezzeh基地的F-15E（Hammer2）和两批F/A-18（Knight1/2）提供防空压制走廊。\n\n从Akrotiri起飞后，我们将经Silver走廊飞至6号航点转入贝卡谷地。8号航点标记任务区起点，预计抵达时间Zulu时03:40。负责的压制走廊从8号延伸至10号航点，9号点位于Mezzeh。在03:40-04:00Z任务窗口期间需确保压制或摧毁所有威胁——彻底摧毁优于暂时压制。攻击编队TOT为03:55Z。\n\n该区域防御严密：Mezzeh部署有SA-2/SA-3固定阵地。由于南面以色列威胁及任务走廊内大量叙利亚陆军基地，还需应对多种机动防空系统。电子战支援由Spartan3提供，在大马士革以北实施干扰。必须严格规避戈兰高地。\n\n攻击编队撤离后，我们将经11号集结点沿贝卡谷地返航。虽然近期任务削弱了该区域威胁，但仍属叙利亚控制区。\n\n由于AGM-65库存不足，本次任务我将挂载4枚GBU-38。Rotor携带4枚HARM导弹，可见任务强度。最低返航油量3600磅。\n\n预期威胁包括全谱系高炮及多种地空导弹：SA-2/3/6/8/9/11/13。需严格保持任务走廊位置——西侧戈兰高地与东侧大马士革周边部署有密集近程防空。虽然叙利亚空军很少干扰行动，但为防万一，大马士革附近有F-15C双机编队（呼号Renegade2）提供CAP掩护。\n\n完成详尽规划后，简报结束。我和Rotor抓紧时间休息——明天需要黎明起飞，今天的疲惫让我们更需要睡眠。",

  "Something big is going down in Syria.\n\nWe returned to Akortiri this morning, having flown a mission south of Damascus in support of an attack on Mezzeh airbase.  Our strikers were going after the latest round of supplies delivered by the Russians before the Syrians could whisk them away to the front line.  Once again we encountered a heavy SAM presence in the Syrian south, as well as some Mig-29s eager to join the fight.  I then saw the Russians getting pretty worked up again as I returned to Akrotiri, with an unusually large package of aircraft leaving Russian airspace.  I still don't know what that's all about, but I have a feeling I will soon find out.\n\nAnother curiosity as I returned to base was the arrival of two Strike Eagles at Akrotiri, after all it's pretty rare to see them all the way out here.  Turns out they were here to do some planning with the boss, just what exactly I still don't know, neither do I know yet if whatever's happening in Syria will be a part of it.\n\nSo a lot of questions, and not a lot of answers.  At least not yet.  I spent a few hours after the debrief unwinding at Akrotiri with Bug and Tank.  We all had plenty to say about losing Rotor, we're certainly  going to miss him around the det.  Finally, when orders came in to report for a late afternoon briefing, the three of us made our way over to our ops building, eager to find out more about what was happening.\n\nWe entered the briefing room, noting 4 new faces in USAF flight suits already seated at the front.  As we seated ourselves alongside the rest of the det Popeye began to speak.\n\n\"OK everyone, let's get started.  First of all let me welcome our friends from the Rocketeers down here at the front\".  Popeye gestured at the four new faces with a mischievous smile.  \"I'm sure you've already seen the eyesores that are Mud Hens taking up our parking spaces out on the ramp.  Lt. Col Smith here has come out to plan a set of missions with us, so be sure to afford all the proper hospitality a non Viper driver deserves.  We'll talk more about what we're planning shortly but first Major Norris has some...well...major news.  Over to you Major\".\n\n\"Thank you sir\" said Major Norris stepping to the podium.  \"The situation in Syria is extremely fast paced right now, we're struggling to accurately confirm all the details but this is the current picture as we understand it\".\n\n\"Early this morning Israel launched a large attack into Syria from the Golan Heights, this caught us all by surprise and was not expected.  However, this attack has not gone well.  The Israeli attack was blunted by stronger than expected Syrian resistance, supported by both Hezbollah and what we believe are Russian mercenaries...not that the Russians will admit to it.  Russian air power also played a part, and in combination with the strong air defenses still present in that region denied the Israeli ground forces adequate air support\".\n\n\"Israel it would seem, has made a big miscalculation\".\n\nNorris clicked a slide onto the briefing screen.\n\n\"After the initial Israeli attack was stopped, the Syrians began to rapidly counter attack into the Golan, utilizing the large number of mechanized and armored units in the area.  The latest report is that the Syrians have penetrated around three miles into the Golan Heights, with the attack led by the 1st AD and 121st infantry brigade.  Two mechanized brigades are also locked in heavy fighting around the border.  We believe the Syrian objective will be the bridges over the River Jordan, likely an attempt to isolate the Golan from the rest of Israel and prevent reinforcements being brought into the fight\".   \n\n\"Efforts are being undertaken by the JSTF as we speak to shore up the Israeli position.  We have made some good early progress, the Syrian advance has been halted...for now at least and the strikes carried out today have certainly hurt the Syrians.  We also now have a large number of Syrian targets out in the open, which presents a golden opportunity.  Lt. Col Doyle will brief your missions shortly, but as you can expect to be operating in this area let me talk to you about the threat picture\".\n\n\"Reports from the debriefs carried out so far are of a very dense missile umbrella over the battle area.  This consists of at least fifteen mobile systems - mostly SA-6 and SA-8 but with at least two SA-11s and we believe two or three SA-15s as well.  The Syrians look like they're throwing everything they've got into the fight.  We're also seeing the Syrian air force a lot more active than usual, with several engagements carried out today with Mig-21s and Mig-29s\".\n\nThe Major asked for questions, and with none forthcoming he departed and Popeye began to brief our next mission\n\n" : "叙利亚正酝酿重大事件。\n\n今晨返回Akrotiri基地前，我们执行了大马士革以南的作战任务，支援对迈宰空军基地的突袭。攻击机群目标是拦截俄方最新运抵、尚未被叙军转移至前线的补给物资。叙利亚南部再次出现密集的防空导弹网，还有急于参战的米格-29机群。返航途中，我注意到俄军异常调动——大批战机编队正离开俄领空，这已是近期第二次。虽不明缘由，但预感真相即将揭晓。\n\n基地还出现了罕见情况：两架打击鹰战机降落Akrotiri。原来他们专程来与指挥官制定作战计划，具体内容尚不清楚，也不知是否与叙利亚局势相关。\n\n诸多疑问尚未解答。任务简报后，我与Bug、Tank在基地休整，聊起失去Rotor的痛楚——小队永远怀念这位战友。傍晚接到简报通知时，我们迫不及待赶往作战中心。\n\n简报室内，四名身着空军飞行服的陌生面孔已就座。随着全员到齐，Popeye开场道：\"欢迎'火箭手'中队的战友们\"，他促狭地指了指新面孔，\"想必各位都注意到停机坪上碍眼的泥母鸡了。史密斯中校将与我们协同作战，请给这些非蝮蛇飞行员应有的'礼遇'。具体任务稍后讨论，首先由诺里斯少校通报...重大消息。\"\n\n\"感谢长官。\"诺里斯少校走向讲台，\"叙利亚局势瞬息万变。据现有情报：今晨以色列突然从戈兰高地发动大规模进攻，但遭遇叙军、真主党及疑似俄雇佣兵的强力阻击。俄空军参战加上该区域顽强防空火力，导致以军地面部队缺乏空中支援。\"\n\n\"以色列显然严重误判了形势。\"\n\n幻灯片切换至战区地图。\n\n\"叙军趁势反击，动用大量机械化部队向戈兰高地推进。最新战报显示，第1装甲师与121步兵旅已深入高地三英里，两机械化旅仍在边境激战。其战略目标可能是约旦河桥梁，意图切断戈兰高地与以色列本土联系。\"\n\n\"联合特遣部队正在稳固以军防线。当前取得初步成效：叙军攻势暂缓，今日空袭对其造成重创。更关键的是，大量叙军目标暴露在开阔地带。多伊尔中校稍后将下达具体任务，我先通报威胁态势。\"\n\n\"战场上空存在至少十五个机动防空系统，以萨姆-6/8为主，另有两套萨姆-11及三套萨姆-15。叙空军活动显著增强，今日已发生多起米格-21/29交战记录。\"\n\n少校询问环节结束后，Popeye开始部署下一阶段任务。",

  "\"OK then, let's get to it\" Popeye began.  \"The Syrian attack into the Golan has put Israeli forces in a bad situation, but with the support of the JSTF their position has now just about been stabilized.  This presents us with a golden opportunity\".\n\n\"We believe the Syrians have over-reached, their response to the Israeli attack has brought a number of their most capable units out into the open.  This leaves them exposed to widespread attack from JSTF air power, giving us an opportunity to deliver a huge blow to the Syrian military and maybe bring this war to a close sooner.  However, as Major Norris has already said, the Syrians have also deployed a large SAM umbrella over the area, this is preventing us from completing that task...and so as you're probably expecting...we're going to go in and kick the door open\".\n\n\"Tomorrow we're going to run a series of missions south of Damascus.  The objective of these missions will be simple, hunt out and kill every SAM we can and make the area more permissive for follow on JSTF strikes.  However, as you know, this area is a long way from Akrotiri, limiting our time on station.  Therefore each flight will be carrying out two vuls in the AOR, with a stop in Jordan between each vul for fuel and weapons\".\n\n\"H4 again?\" Bug asked quizzically.\n\n\"No, not H4\" replied Popeye.  \"Jordan has opened up two further bases to us in the north of the country - King Hussein and Muwaffaq Salti.  We will be using Muwaffaq Salti\".  \n\n\"Will we be operating in the same airspace as the Israelis?\" I asked.\n\n\"No,\" replied Popeye.  \"They are fully aware of our plans and have assured us they will keep out the way, which should remove the threat of an unintentional tangle with Russian aircraft as well\". \n\nI sensed Shade shifting uncomfortably behind me at this point.  Popeye continued.\n\n\"As we heard, the Syrians are committing to the aerial fight more readily as well, so each flight will have a flight of Eagles commit to a fighter sweep ahead of them\".\n\nPopeye then shifted his gaze to the four Strike Eagle crews at the front.\n\n\"Now let's discuss where our Strike Eagle friends come into this.  We've been planning a collaborative effort for some time, and with the recent developments down south...well let's say \nthis seems like the perfect time to put them into action\".\n\n\"Now everyone in this room knows the Viper is the greatest airplane ever built, but even greatness can have it's shortcomings...and in the Viper this is fuel and weapons.  The Syrians have a lot of SAMs out there and as we've found out these last two months there are just not enough of us to deliver a knockout blow once and for all.  This is where the Strike Eagles can assist us.  We will enter an area and neutralize the SAM radars, and once we've made it a safer environment Lt. Col Smith's  Strike Eagles will then roll in after us and obliterate the rest of the site.  Given the long loiter time of the Mud Hen and it's big weapons load, we should work very well together\".\n\nI noted a few grins around the room as Popeye described our plans, this was old school Weasel tactics, with shades of Vietnam and Desert Storm and we were all clearly excited to fly such a mission.\n\nWith the mission overview completed, we started to breakdown the mission in detail.\n\nSword 2, consisting of Boomer and myself, will depart Akrotiri at 04:00Z alongside Sword 3 (Shade and Bug) and proceed as standard into Syria through the Silver Corridor.  Once clear of Silver at waypoint 6 we will turn southeast for waypoint 7 where we will rendezvous with Renegade 4, an Eagle four ship who will carry out a fighter sweep ahead of us.  Renegade's push time is 04:35 Zulu.\n\nOnce Renegade pushes south we will follow in behind them towards waypoint 8, trailing by about 10 miles. It will be essential we keep behind Renegade as they push, we do not want to end between them and any targets.  Should Renegade be engaged by any SAMs we will then be in a position to react accordingly and cover them as they fall back.\n\nWe will follow the fighter sweep through to waypoint 9, which loops us east around Damascus, avoiding the AAA and SHORAD around the city and it's airbases.  Renegade will turn back for home at waypoint 9, where we will then push to our AOR for our first vul.  Our initial vul time begins at 04:50.  We will receive jamming support from Spartan 2 between 04:50Z and 05:20Z.\n\nOur AOR will be the region south west of Damascus, north of a line drawn between waypoint 9 (Khalkhalah airbase)  and waypoint 10.  Sword 3 will be responsible for the area south of this line extending out to Tha'lah airbase.  We will have overlapping vuls and so will be in a position to provide each other with mutual support if needed.  During our initial vul we will be hunting for and killing SAMs, Vacuum will be on hand to assist us in locating targets.\n\nWe should not go further west than waypoint 10 as this will put us in the Golan Heights, the Israelis are currently fighting in this area so we should ensure we deconflict.\n\nOnce our vul is over at 05:20Z, or earlier should we be bingo or winchester, then we will egress south to Jordan, where we will land at Muwaffaq Salti, coordinating with their air traffic control as we do so.\n\nWe will be on the ground in Jordan for around two hours as the aircraft are turned around, this will give us a short time to stretch our legs and refocus to go back out again.  We will takeoff for our second vul at 08:20Z, with a time on station of 08:30Z.  Spartan 4 will be on station to provide jamming from 08:30Z - 09:30Z.  During this vul we will be operating in the same AORs again, with a two ship of Smith's Strike Eagles (callsign Rock 3) planned to join us, with a TOT of 08:40Z.  Once our second vul is complete we will return home to Akrotiri.\n\nFor our first vul Boomer will carry 2 HARMs, I will be carrying 2 CBU-105s and 2 Mavericks.  Our bingo from the AOR to Muwaffaq Salti is 2,000 lb.\n\nBullseye will be located on Damascus International Airport.\n\nThis mission looks like it's going to expose us to a wide range of threats.  While the area north of Damascus is now largely clear of SAMs, south of Damascus it's a different story.  Several SA-11s, and large numbers of SA-6s and SA-8s have created a large missile umbrella over the area.  This will be tough to operate in so I'll need to rely on the effectiveness of Spartan's jamming and every trick I know to keep myself safe.\n\nAs always, good situational awareness will be important.  We can expect heavy SHORAD located at Damascus International Airport, Marj Ruhayill, Khalkhalah and Mezzeh airbases, as well as along the frontline in support of the Syrian ground forces.  This will be especially true around the Golan, where Syrian SHORAD is particularly heavy.\n\nFinally we should be prepared for air to air threats as well, with Mig-21, Mig-23 and Mig-29 all potential threats.\n\nThe briefing then drew to a close, and we filed out the room, silent and deep in thought.  On the way out we stopped by the weather shop and got a met brief from the OMT, the weather tomorrow is expected to be scattered to broken clouds at 9,000 feet with winds of around 10 knots on the deck.\n\nLater, as we were continuing our mission prep, we got word of a shootdown of a JSTF Strike Eagle.  We didn't need it, but it was another reminder of just how hostile an area we were going into tomorrow.\n\nI'll need to bring my A-game.\n\n\n" : "\"好，我们开始吧\"Popeye开场说道。\"叙利亚对戈兰高地的进攻使以色列军队陷入困境，但在JSTF支持下，他们的防线现在基本稳定了。这给我们创造了黄金机会\"。\n\n\"我们认为叙利亚人战线拉得太长，他们对以色列反击的回应使其许多精锐部队暴露在外。这使得他们容易遭受JSTF空中力量的全面打击，让我们有机会重创叙利亚军队，或许能提前结束这场战争。不过正如Norris少校所说，叙利亚人还在该区域部署了大范围防空导弹网，阻碍我们完成任务...所以你们应该猜到了...我们要去踹开这扇门\"。\n\n\"明天我们将在大马士革以南执行系列任务。目标很简单：猎杀尽可能多的防空导弹，为后续JSTF打击创造有利环境。但如你们所知，该区域距离Akrotiri很远，限制了我们空中停留时间。因此每个编队将在任务区执行两次作战窗口，期间在约旦停靠补给燃料和武器\"。\n\n\"又是H4基地？\"Bug疑惑地问。\n\n\"不，不是H4\"Popeye回答。\"约旦向我们开放了北部的两个新基地——King Hussein和Muwaffaq Salti。我们将使用Muwaffaq Salti\"。\n\n\"我们会与以色列空军在同一空域行动吗？\"我问道。\n\n\"不会\"Popeye回答。\"他们完全知晓我们的计划，保证会避开，这应该也能避免与俄罗斯军机意外纠缠\"。\n\n此时我感觉到身后的Shade不安地动了动。Popeye继续道：\n\n\"如我们所知，叙利亚人也更积极参与空战，所以每个编队都会有一支鹰式战机分队在前方执行战斗机扫荡\"。\n\nPopeye将目光转向前排的四名攻击鹰机组人员：\n\n\"现在说说我们的攻击鹰朋友如何参与。我们筹划联合作战已有时日，鉴于南部近期事态...现在正是行动的最佳时机\"。\n\n\"在座各位都知道蝮蛇是有史以来最伟大的战机，但伟大也有短板...对蝮蛇而言就是燃料和武器载量。叙利亚部署了大量防空导弹，过去两个月证明单靠我们无法彻底摧毁它们。这时攻击鹰就能协助我们：我们先压制雷达，等环境安全后Smith中校的攻击鹰就会跟进摧毁剩余设施。凭借泥母鸡的长航时和大载弹量，我们应该能完美配合\"。\n\n当Popeye描述计划时，我注意到房间里几人露出笑容。这是典型的野鼬鼠战术，带着越战和沙漠风暴的影子，显然大家都为执行这种任务感到兴奋。\n\n任务概述结束后，我们开始细化分工。\n\n由Boomer和我组成的Sword2将与Sword3（Shade和Bug）于04:00Z从Akrotiri起飞，经银走廊常规进入叙利亚。通过银走廊6号航点后转向东南，在7号航点与执行前方战斗机扫荡的鹰式四机编队Renegade4汇合。Renegade的出击时间为04:35Z。\n\nRenegade南推后，我们将保持10英里距离尾随至8号航点。必须保持在Renegade后方，绝不能位于他们与目标之间。若Renegade遭导弹攻击，我们将及时反应掩护其撤退。\n\n跟随战斗机扫荡至9号航点绕行大马士革东部，避开城区及机场的防空火力。Renegade将在9号航点返航，我们则进入首个作战窗口，开始时间04:50Z。04:50Z至05:20Z期间将获得Spartan2的电子干扰支援。\n\n我们的责任区是大马士革西南部，9号航点（Khalkhalah基地）与10号航点连线以北。Sword3负责该线以南至Tha'lah基地区域。重叠的作战窗口让我们能互相支援。首轮任务中我们将猎杀防空导弹，Vacuum会协助定位目标。\n\n不要越过10号航点西进，以免进入戈兰高地——以军当前战区需注意规避。\n\n作战窗口于05:20Z结束（若提前耗尽弹药或燃料则更早），我们将南向撤离至约旦Muwaffaq Salti基地，途中与空管协调。\n\n地面整备约两小时，期间可稍作休整。08:20Z起飞执行第二轮任务，08:30Z到达战位。Spartan4将在08:30Z-09:30Z提供干扰。此阶段Smith的攻击鹰双机编队（呼号Rock3）计划于08:40Z加入我们。任务结束后返回Akrotiri。\n\n首轮任务中Boomer携带2枚HARM导弹，我携带2枚CBU-105集束炸弹和2枚小牛导弹。从责任区到Muwaffaq Salti的返航油量底线为2000磅。\n\n基准点设在大马士革国际机场。\n\n此任务将面临多重威胁。虽然大马士革北部防空导弹大多已被清除，但南部仍有大量SA-11、SA-6和SA-8构成的导弹网。需要依靠Spartan的干扰效果和所有战术技巧来保全自己。\n\n保持良好态势感知至关重要。大马士革国际机场、Marj Ruhayill、Khalkhalah和Mezzeh基地及前线区域都有密集近程防空火力，戈兰高地周边尤为密集。\n\n还需警惕米格-21、米格-23和米格-29的空中威胁。\n\n简报结束后我们默默走出会议室，途中在气象室获知明日天气：9000英尺高度有碎云，地面风速约10节。\n\n后续任务准备时，传来JSTF攻击鹰被击落的消息。这再次提醒我们明日将进入多么危险的区域。\n\n我必须全力以赴。",

  "We are due to take off again at 08:20Z, I will depart Muwaffaq Salti with Boomer and proceed back into Syria.  We will rendezvous with our EW support Spartan 4, and our CAP Bear 5, at waypoint 2, which marks the Syrian border.  Both will then escort us into Syria and Spartan will provide a standoff jam against any SAMs in our AOR.  Spartan will anchor at waypoint 3, which is also our IP.  This area has already been cleansed of SAMs and should now be low in threat.  \n\nWaypoint 4 marks the town of Qatana, which is the current forward limit of the Syrian force we're attacking.  Once on station we will work to locate and kill any air defense threats in this area.  Our Strike Eagle partners, Rock 3 will also arrive on station at 08:40Z, receiving targets from Sword 2 as they arrive. \n\nWe expect to have some good hunting today, by taking a combined approach with the Rocketeers we will leverage the F-16s superior SAM hunting and suppression capability with the Mud Hens huge bomb load and should be able to do some real damage to the Syrian air defenses in the area.\n\nOnce our vul is over we will rally at waypoint 5 before returning back home to Akrotiri.\n\nThe previous flights operating in this area have reported heavy mobile air defenses moving with the Syrian ground forces.  We should anticipate a mix of SA-6, SA-8, SA-11 and SA-15 as well as the usual variety of AAA, MANPADS, SA-9 and SA-13 at low level.  We should keep clear of the Syrian air bases around Damascus as well, as they will contain significant SHORAD.\n\nBingo fuel from the target area is 3,500 lb.\n\nWith the details of our second vul ironed out,  we returned to their ramp to find the aircraft ready to go again, both of us equipped with two HARMs.  We updated our kneeboards with our new mission details and stepped back to the jets.\n\nThere's another tough fight ahead of us, the Syrians have their backs against the wall right now and we suspect they will fight like hell because of it.  The Russians still loom large in the background as well and remain an unknown quantity, especially when it comes to Israel.  There's still so much uncertainty out here and Syria still has a long way to go until it sees peace again.  This is bigger than any one group of pilots, but maybe, if we can finally deliver a killing blow to the Syrian air defenses, we might just start to see the path to ending this war.\n" : "我们计划于08:20Z再次起飞，我将与Boomer从Muwaffaq Salti出发重返叙利亚。我们将在航点2（叙利亚边境标记处）与电子战支援单位Spartan 4及空中巡逻单位Bear 5汇合。随后两者将护送我们进入叙利亚，Spartan将对任务区内所有防空导弹实施防区外干扰。Spartan将锚定在航点3——该点同时也是我们的初始点（IP）。该区域已清除防空导弹威胁，目前威胁等级较低。\n\n航点4标记着卡塔纳镇，这是当前叙利亚进攻部队的前沿边界。进入作战区域后，我们将定位并消灭该地区所有防空威胁。我们的打击鹰搭档Rock 3也将于08:40Z抵达作战区，他们到达时将接收来自Sword 2的目标指示。\n\n今天预计会有丰厚战果：通过与Rocketeers联合作战，我们将发挥F-16卓越的防空压制能力，配合\"Mud Hens\"的巨大载弹量，必将给该地区的叙利亚防空体系造成实质性打击。\n\n作战窗口结束后，我们将在航点5集结，随后返回Akrotiri基地。\n\n此前在该区域执行任务的机组报告，伴随叙利亚地面部队移动的机动防空火力十分密集。我们应做好应对SA-6、SA-8、SA-11、SA-15混合部署的准备，低空还有常规的防空炮、单兵防空导弹、SA-9和SA-13威胁。同时需远离大马士革周边的叙军机场，这些区域部署有强大的近程防空系统。\n\n目标区域的最低返航油量为3,500磅。\n\n敲定第二轮作战细节后，我们回到停机坪发现战机已准备就绪——两架都挂载了两枚HARM导弹。我们更新了膝板上的任务简报，再次登上战机。\n\n更艰巨的战斗即将来临：叙利亚人现在背水一战，势必负隅顽抗。俄罗斯势力仍在幕后若隐若现，特别是涉及以色列时更充满变数。这片土地仍充满不确定性，叙利亚距离重获和平还有漫漫长路。这远非任何一支飞行小队能单独解决的任务，但若能对叙利亚防空体系实施致命打击，或许就能为结束这场战争开辟道路。",

  "Well that was an intense mission, they weren't kidding when they said the Syrians had put a missile shield over the frontline.  After a tough fight, Boomer and I landed here at Muwaffaq Salti in Jordan, where we've had a few hours to stretch our legs as the crews got to work on rearming and refueling the jets.\n\nShade and Bug also landed shortly after us.  I managed to catch up with Bug, who was not impressed with Shade one bit, \"A convenient malfunction\" as Bug described it, referring to Shade's equipment failure keeping him out of the fight.  Maybe, maybe not...I'm not so sure.  It could actually  just be a coincidence and I'm starting to get the feeling Bug really has a chip on his shoulder about Shade. \n\nPopeye, Tank and Ghost also landed here about 30 minutes ago following their vul over the frontline.  They gave us a quick update on the situation they left, having picked up where Sword 2 and Sword 3 left off.\n\nIt sounds like the three of them had a pretty successful time of it and they reported the AOR out towards the Golan Heights now almost cleared of SAMs.  We were in the process of beginning to plan our operating area for our second vul when Popeye received new instructions directly from the CAOC.\n\nThe CAOC had sent intelligence about a large Syrian Mechanized formation, consisting of a mix of T-72, BMP-2 and BTR-80, approaching the Syrian/Lebanese border west of Damascus.  This was likely the remnants of the large force deployed to the Bekaa Valley in the Syrian push north and are probably being pulled back south to support the ongoing battle with Israeli forces.\n\nAdvanced elements of the Syrian force have been identified digging in around the town of Qatana, seven miles southwest of Mezzeh airbase, with the rest of the force still transiting across the Lebanese border.  North of Qatana is what appears to be a storage and assembly area for the Syrian armor, it is expected the formation will rearm and refuel here before pushing south.  The CAOC does not intend to allow that to happen.\n \nInitial JSTF attacks against this force have achieved only limited success, due to the heavy air defense escort the formation is moving with.  Our det has therefore been tasked with eliminating the air defenses protecting the ground force, opening the way for the JSTF to work and smash the Syrian force before it can join the fight.  As previously arranged, Rock 3 will be joining us to provide support in this mission.\n" : "这次任务确实激烈，叙利亚人在前线部署导弹防御系统的说法毫不夸张。经过一番苦战，Boomer和我降落在约旦的Muwaffaq Salti基地，地勤人员忙着给战机重新装弹加油时，我们获得了几个小时的休整时间。\n\nShade和Bug随后也陆续降落。我找机会和Bug聊了聊，他对Shade显然很不满，用\"凑巧的机械故障\"来形容Shade因装备问题未能参战的情况。这事真假难说...我开始觉得Bug对Shade确实心存芥蒂。\n\nPopeye、Tank和Ghost三十分钟前完成前线战斗巡逻后也在此降落。他们简要通报了接替Sword 2和Sword 3后的战场态势。\n\n看来他们三人战果颇丰，报告称戈兰高地方向的作战区域已基本清除防空导弹。我们正开始规划第二次战斗巡逻区域时，Popeye突然接到CAOC直接下达的新指令。\n\nCAOC情报显示，一支由T-72坦克、BMP-2步战车和BTR-80装甲车混编的叙利亚机械化部队正朝大马士革以西的叙黎边境移动。这很可能是之前部署在贝卡谷地的残余部队，现正南调支援与以军的战斗。\n\n叙利亚先遣部队已在Mezzeh空军基地西南七英里的Qatana镇周边构筑阵地，主力仍在穿越黎巴嫩边境。Qatana北部疑似叙军装甲部队的补给装配区，预计该部队将在此补充燃料弹药后南下。CAOC决心阻止这个计划。\n\n联合特种作战部队先前发起的攻击收效甚微，因该纵队有严密防空系统随行。我分队受命清除其防空力量，为联合部队扫清道路，争取在叙军投入战斗前予以歼灭。按原定计划，Rock 3将加入本次任务提供支援。",

  "\"Ok guys, there's a situation developing in the Bekaa valley, let me bring you up to speed.  As you know the Syrians have been in the process of moving a large mechanized force south from the Bekaa to Qatana, in preparation to have it enter the fight around the Golan.  What you might not know is that we had several teams of special operations forces in the valley as well, providing surveillance on Syrian and Hezbollah troop movements.  One of these teams has been compromised and are cut off in the south Bekaa\".\n\n\"This team is in a particularly perilous position, trapped between Hezbollah forces occupying the Lebanon mountains to the west, and Syrian armored forces to the east and south east.  They have gone defensive in this location, a farm complex northeast of the village of Aammiq, however both Syria and Hezbollah know where they are\".  \n\n\"The SOF team's callsign is Copper 3-2.  They have already beaten back several light probing attacks made against them so far, and have reported knocking out two T-72s in the process with AT weapons.  This has given the Syrians pause for thought and bought a little time, but once the Syrians and Hezbollah figure out a large sustained attack will succeed then they have little chance of holding out.  The army has Blackhawks inbound to extract the team and we have A-10s ready to provide CAS, but....\"\n\n\"Let me guess...\" I interrupted, \"...too hot for them to get in at the moment?\"\n\n\"How'd you guess\", Shade replied sarcastically.  \"The Syrian mechanized formation comes equipped with a variety of SHORAD, this needs to be gone before the helos and A-10s can get in.  The four of us will be providing force protection to the operation, relieving Sword 1 who are covering the first vul as we speak\".\n\n\"What sort of SHORAD are we looking at?\" I asked.\n\n\"Reports so far are of SA-9s and ZSU-23-4s as well.  No reports yet of any SA-6s or SA-11s in the area but we should still be prepared for them just in case\".\n\nShade continued, breaking down the mission.\n\nOur takeoff time is 11:30Z.  Once airborne we will rendezvous with Sword 3 at waypoint 1 before pushing back north into Syria via waypoint 2.\n\nWe will proceed north through Syria up to waypoint 4, again keeping clear of the Golan as we do so.  At waypoint 3 we will turn northwest for waypoint 4, which marks our IP and the southern edge of our AOR.  We should not fly south of waypoint 4 as this risks us encroaching upon the Golan.\n\nOnce on station at the target area, we should check in with Copper 3-2 before searching for and destroying any air defense units in the vicinity of the farm.  Waypoint 5 is set on Copper 3-2's position, and waypoint 6 marks the SAA staging area.  \n\nOnce the area is clear of air defenses we will remain on station to cover the arrival of the A-10 flight (Gunman) and the Blackhawks (Archangel) as they begin the extraction of Copper 3-2.  Once they are safely away we will rendezvous at the rally point at waypoint 7, before flowing back home to Akrotiri.\n\nStores of weapons at Muwaffaq Salti are beginning to run low and HARMS and Mavs are currently depleted so my loadout for this mission is 2 GBU-12s and 2 GBU-38s.  Boomer will be carrying the same, with Shade and Bug carrying 2 GBU-31s each.  \n\nBingo fuel for a return to Akrotiri is 3,100 lb.\n\nAs ever with operations in the Bekaa Valley, we are not authorized to cross the Lebanon mountains and enter the western, coastal region of Lebanon.  Shade was really keen to emphasize this, there's a lot at stake in this operation and a lot of eyes watching it...and us.\n\nWe finished up by discussing threats.  After a hard day's work from our Weasel detachment we've already put a serious dent in the Syrian SAM umbrella in the south Damascus region, there are no indications currently of any remaining SA-6s or SA-11s in this area or in the Bekaa, but of course we should expect the unexpected.  There will however be SHORAD units present in the Bekaa Valley and the Syria/Lebanon border region that are moving with the SAA units in this area.  SHORAD we would typically expect to see with these sorts of formations would be ZSU-23-4,  SA-8, SA-9, SA-13 and possibly SA-15.  Hezbollah forces will likely have MANPAD systems as well so we should ensure we maintain a safe altitude whenever possible.\n\nWith the briefing finished we all set to work preparing for our individual flights, checking in with the crews working our jets and filling out new kneeboards.  It's been a hell of a day so far, this is our third sortie since leaving Akrotiri and we're all tired and are being pushed to the edge.  I could already tell during the briefing that fatigue was starting to creep in, but we've got guys on the ground in harm's way and I could see the determination in the others to get the job done.\n\nFailure is not an option.\n" : "\"伙计们，贝卡谷地局势有变，我来同步最新情况。众所周知叙利亚军队正从贝卡向卡塔纳南调大规模机械化部队，准备投入戈兰高地战斗。你们可能不知道的是，我们也有多支特种部队小组在谷地监视叙利亚和真主党部队动向，其中一支小组已经暴露，被困在贝卡南部。\"\n\n\"这支小组处境极其危险，西侧被占据黎巴嫩山脉的真主党部队包围，东面和东南方向则是叙利亚装甲部队。他们目前在Aammiq村东北的农场建筑群转入防御，但叙利亚和真主党都已掌握其位置。\"\n\n\"该特战小组呼号为Copper 3-2。他们已击退数次试探性进攻，并报告用反坦克武器摧毁了两辆T-72。这虽让叙利亚部队暂时迟疑，但等他们组织起大规模持续进攻，特战小组就很难坚守。陆军已派出黑鹰直升机接应，A-10也待命提供近距空中支援，但......\"\n\n\"让我猜猜...\"我打断道，\"...现在进场太危险？\"\n\n\"真是一猜就中，\"Shade语带嘲讽，\"叙利亚机械化部队配有多种近程防空系统，必须清除这些威胁才能让直升机和A-10进场。我们四人将为行动提供武力掩护，接替正在执行首轮战斗空中巡逻的Sword 1小队。\"\n\n\"具体有哪些近程防空？\"我问道。\n\n\"目前报告有SA-9和ZSU-23-4，尚未发现该区域有SA-6或SA-11，但仍需做好应对准备。\"\n\nShade继续分解任务细节：\n\n起飞时间11:30Z。升空后与Sword 3在1号航路点汇合，随后经2号航路点向北进入叙利亚。\n\n沿叙利亚境内向北飞至4号航路点，全程避让戈兰空域。在3号航路点转向西北前往4号航路点——该点既是初始进入点也是责任区南界。严禁飞越4号航路点以南以免侵入戈兰。\n\n抵达目标区后应先与Copper 3-2确认状态，再搜索摧毁农场周边防空单位。5号航路点标记特战小组位置，6号航路点为叙利亚政府军集结区。\n\n肃清防空威胁后，我们将留空掩护A-10编队（呼号Gunman）和黑鹰直升机（呼号Archangel）接应Copper 3-2。待其安全撤离后，全队至7号航路点集结点汇合，最后返回Akrotiri基地。\n\nMuwaffaq Salti基地的HARM和Maverick导弹库存告罄，因此本次任务我的挂载方案是2枚GBU-12加2枚GBU-38。Boomer采用相同配置，Shade和Bug各挂载2枚GBU-31。\n\n返回Akrotiri的最低燃油量为3100磅。\n\n贝卡谷地行动严禁飞越黎巴嫩山脉进入西侧沿海地区。Shade特别强调这点，此次行动牵涉重大，无数眼睛正盯着我们。\n\n最后我们讨论了威胁评估。经过野鼬鼠分队全天奋战，大马士革南部区域的叙利亚防空网已遭重创，目前贝卡谷地未见SA-6或SA-11活动迹象，但仍需警惕突发状况。贝卡谷地及叙黎边境伴随政府军移动的近程防空系统可能包括ZSU-23-4、SA-8、SA-9、SA-13及潜在SA-15。真主党武装可能配备单兵防空导弹，务必保持安全高度。\n\n简报结束后我们各自准备：检查战机状态、更新膝板图表。这已是离开Akrotiri后的第三次出击，全员疲惫濒临极限。简报时我就察觉大家开始显露疲态，但想到地面战友危在旦夕，每个人眼中都闪烁着完成任务的决心。\n\n我们别无选择，只许成功。",

  "It's great to be flying again!  After 2 weeks on the ground it was certainly a relief to be back in the air and doing what we trained to do.\n\nOur sortie over the no fly zone wasn't as exciting as we've become accustomed to, but it certainly wasn't boring either.  I'm not sure there's such a thing as an uneventful flight in Syria these days.  Our mission was to patrol the no fly zone and give cover to Mastiff 3 -  a recon flight of aging French Mirage F1s.  On our outbound leg over the Med we encountered a Russian surface group transiting towards their base at Tartus, followed by Russian Flankers over the no fly zone and a Bear on our inbound leg.  The Russians are certainly very active right now.\n\nBut that goes for the Syrians as well and I have to grudgingly give them some credit.  Although their air defense losses have been heavy and their command and control networks severely degraded, they still have plenty of fight left in them, as shown by the SA-6 systems harassing us as we patrolled the no fly zone.  This conflict still has a way to go I think.\n\nBack here at Akrotiri our reinforcements have arrived, with Shade and Boomer flying in with two extra Vipers.  They settled in quickly, flying a fam flight with the boss and Rotor yesterday.  Rotor was Shade's wingman in the second element, and once back in our dorm it was clear that Rotor had not enjoyed the experience flying with Shade again.\n\nBut what's past is past, and today we have another mission so we put any negative thoughts from our mind and focused on what was to come.\n\nWe arrived at the briefing room bathed in the early morning sun, and it was clear we were looking at more excellent weather today.  Settling into our chairs, we couldn't help but notice the gap left in the seats between Shade and Rotor.\n\nPopeye kicked things off by inviting the Operational Meteorologist Technician to speak and we received our weather briefing.  As expected we were forecast sunshine all day, with just a few scattered clouds around 7,000 feet and little wind once again.  However the OMT did warn us that in the next couple of days some storms were expected to form, but for today at least everything looks good.\n\nOnce the OMT had departed, Major Norris returned to give us an intel update.  He had some significant news for us, revealing that the SDF had broken through at Yabrud, overrun An Nasiriyah airbase, and were starting to push south.  Given that only three days ago Norris told us that the stalemate looked set to continue for some time we made sure he got some stick.  Norris responded that serious fuel and ammunition shortages within the SAA were having a dramatic effect, shortages that the Major put down to the success of Operation Dominant Enforcer.  The frontline for the SDF and SAA was therefore changing rapidly, something we needed to be aware of when in the air.\n\nTurning to the Russian supply ships we saw out at sea, Norris told us that it appeared these contained a variety of armored vehicles, including mobile SAM systems.  However the Syrians currently can't move these from isolated northwestern Syria to reinforce the south without Russian airlift support.  As a result we are closely watching Russian air bases for any sign of this, but for now at least these new SAMs are no threat.\n\nDiscussing Hezbollah, Norris informed us that they remain active in the border region, although they have yet to engage in anything other than small opportunistic attacks on SDF forces.  They do however pose a threat to the Homs road and the essential supply lines with the north.\n\nNorris finished his intel brief and as he departed he turned the podium over to Popeye, who began his mission brief." : "能再次飞行真是太棒了！在地面待了两周后，重返天空执行训练任务确实让人如释重负。我们在禁飞区的巡逻任务虽然不如往常刺激，但也绝不乏味。如今在叙利亚，恐怕没有哪次飞行能称得上平淡无奇。本次任务是为老旧的法国幻影F1侦察机\"Mastiff 3\"提供禁飞区巡逻掩护。飞越地中海时遭遇了向塔尔图斯基地转移的俄罗斯水面舰队，随后在禁飞区遇到俄军侧卫战机，返航时又碰上一架熊式轰炸机——俄军近期活动确实相当频繁。\n\n但叙利亚人同样不甘示弱，我必须不情愿地承认他们的顽强。尽管防空系统损失惨重，指挥控制网络严重瘫痪，他们仍保有可观的战斗力——禁飞区巡逻时骚扰我们的SA-6系统就是明证。看来这场冲突还将持续。\n\nAkrotiri基地迎来了增援部队，Shade和Boomer驾驶两架新增的毒蛇战机进驻。他们迅速投入状态，昨天刚与指挥官Rotor完成适应性飞行。担任第二编队僚机的Rotor在宿舍里明确表示不愿再与Shade搭档。不过往事已矣，今天又有新任务，我们必须抛开负面情绪专注当下。\n\n晨光中的简报室格外明亮，显然今天又是绝佳天气。入座时，Shade与Rotor之间的空位格外显眼。Popeye首先请气象作战技术员进行天气简报：全天晴好，7000英尺高度偶有碎云，风力微弱。不过技术员警告未来几天可能出现暴风雨，至少今日天气无忧。\n\nNorris少校随后带来情报更新：叙利亚民主军突破亚布鲁德战线，攻占An Nasiriyah空军基地并开始南推——要知道三天前他还说僵局将持续。我们自然没少揶揄他。少校解释称叙利亚政府军严重的油料弹药短缺改变了战局，这要归功于\"主宰执行者行动\"的成功。前线态势瞬息万变，空中行动需格外注意。\n\n关于海上发现的俄军补给船，少校透露其载有包括机动防空系统在内的各类装甲车辆。但若无俄军空运支援，叙军目前无法将这些装备从西北部调往南方。我们正密切监视俄军机场动向，不过暂时这些新防空系统尚不构成威胁。\n\n谈及真主党，Norris通报他们仍在边境活动，目前仅对叙利亚民主军发动零星袭击，但对霍姆斯公路及北方补给线构成潜在威胁。\n\n情报简报结束后，Popeye接过讲台开始任务说明。",

  "\"OK then pilots let's get to it\" he began, \"First of all an important update for you all.  The CAOC has just let me know that it has begun to assign CAS missions to JSTF aircraft to support the SDF\".\n\nThis caused us all to look up in surprise, this was big news.  Several squadron members looked unimpressed.\n\n\"That's a big step isn't it sir?\"  asked Tank.\n\n\"Yes it is\", replied Popeye.  \"We can discuss the rights and wrongs and dangers of mission creep all day, but the bottom line is that there appears to be a political will to help the SDF win this thing.  Now while we are unlikely to be tasked with CAS as our primary mission we should be prepared to respond to any urgent tasking we receive so I would recommend you brush up on your CAS knowledge\".\n\n\"Now turning to our mission today.  Syrian radar coverage across the country has been decimated in recent weeks, of course you all know that as you were the ones doing a lot of it...well most of you anyway.  However it looks like the Syrians are attempting to recover some of that capability...recon flights across the southern no fly zone discovered this site under construction yesterday\".\n\nPopeye clicked a slide on the screen at the front of the briefing room.\n\n\"This radar site is located 2 miles north of Sayqal airbase.  As you can see the site consists of a Tin Shield radar, with four SA-8s providing point defense.  The site is still under construction and from the equipment and materials present it appears that the Syrians are attempting to harden the position\".\n\nTank spoke up, \"Bit naive of them isn't it?  We've destroyed almost every radar site the Syrians have, why do they think this one will fare any better?\"\n\n\"Maybe they think throwing a bunch of SA-8s in with it will be enough,\" Ghost replied, smirking.\n\n\"Not a chance!\" replied Rotor.\n\nPopeye continued, \"Well whatever they think, we've been tasked to make sure that site never goes operational.  The position of the site does complicate things however, we have first hand experience of Sayqal's defenses and the site will be within it's AAA umbrella.  We know we also have mobile SAMs operating in that area so we need to be prepared for anything\".\n\n\"So all eight of us will be going up for this one.  I will lead Sword 1, a four ship tasked with SAM suppression in the target area.  We will go in ahead of the main attack, stimulate the enemy air defenses and suppress them.  Sword 2 and Sword 3 will then come in behind us, with Sword 3 throwing bombs onto the AAA positions at Sayqal to suppress them.  Sword 2 will sweep in from the northeast, initiating a low level pop up attack on the radar and command post.  Sword 2 and Sword 3 will then egress north, covered by Sword 1.  Throughout the operation Bear 4, a four ship of Eagles will be on CAP just south of Sierra\".\n\n\"Although you make light of the SA-8s, you know how potent those things can be...and four of them are not to be taken lightly.  This is why Sword 2 will attack from low level, exploiting the low level vulnerability of the SA-8.  Providing you limit your time in the pop then they should be unable to acquire you before you egress, especially as we intend to have them looking at Sword 3 as they suppress the AAA at Sayqal\".\n\nHaving outlined the mission plan, Popeye started to break down each element in more detail.\n\nSword 1, consisting of Popeye, Bug, Ghost and Tank will takeoff at 12:25 Zulu.  They will push into Syrian territory ahead of us, and begin their SEAD mission as we approach the Syrian/SDF frontline.\n\nSword 2 will consist of myself and Boomer, with Rotor being paired with Shade in Sword 3.\n\nSword 2 and 3 will depart from Akortiri, with a takeoff time of 12:35 Zulu.  Once clear of Akrotiri airspace, we will rendezvous at waypoint 4 and transit the silver corridor together, making sure we gain clearance from Sentinel beforehand.\n\nOnce clear of the Silver Corridor at waypoint 6, we will proceed to waypoint 7.  Here we will split the flights, with Sword 3 turning south to begin their attack on the AAA positions at Sayqal.  As Sword 3 turns south, my flight will make a combat descent to 200 feet AGL and continue southeast for waypoint 8 - where we cross the FEBA - before turning south for waypoint 9.\n\nWaypoint 9 is located on a destroyed SAM position, here we will turn southwest and push to our IP at waypoint 10, positioned on a warehouse complex adjoining a road junction, 3.5 miles northeast of the target.\n\nAt the IP I will break hard left 75deg onto a heading of 140, while Boomer initiates a direct attack with high drag bombs.  Once I have rolled out left I will initiate a 25 degree climb to 4,000 ft AGL, before rolling on to the target (the Tin Shield radar at waypoint 11) and releasing my weapons in a 5 degree dive.  This attack profile will ensure I deconflict from Boomer weapons and stay outside his weapon's frag pattern.  We will carry out the attacks with MK-84s, using the considerable frag from the 2000 lb weapons to wipe out the site, and hopefully knock the SA-8s out at the same time.  Once we have released our weapons we will egress north at low level until clear of any potential AAA and SAM threats before climbing to our rally point at waypoint 12.  From here we will cycle back through waypoint 6 into the Silver Corridor and flow back through the waypoints to home.\n\nIt will be vital we hit our timings.  Sword 3 will be on target 3 minutes after we split at waypoint 7, with a vul period of just three minutes.  I need to ensure my flight arrives over the target during this vul period so that the AAA is being suppressed and the SA-8s are distracted.  The AAA will be suppressed by Sword 3 lofting MK-84s fuzed for airbursts over their lines, this should rain frag down on the AAA crews, ensuring any survivors keep under cover and away from their guns.\n\nAs mentioned we will be armed with two MK-84s.  Stockpiles of JDAMs remain low and so we're only using them when we really need to.  We will also be carrying a full air to air load, two bags and all the usual pods.\n\nBingo fuel from the target is 4,150 lb, which if on plan leaves us with around 3,000 lb of excess fuel for contingencies, although we hope not to need it.\n\nDiscussing the threats, Popeye outlined the dangers to us on this mission.  By now we know what to expect - the full range of AAA calibers at Sayqal, including radar guided KS-19s and ZSU-23-4, along with IR SAMs.  Sayqal will contain considerable SHORAD and we should be cautious about approaching the base.\n\nThe SAMs providing area defense should be suppressed by Sword 1, but as always we should be alert to new threats from mobile SAMs such as SA-6 and SA-11.\n\nProviding we execute the attack correctly, we calculate the risk from the SA-8s at the target to be minimal, but we should keep our speed up and stay as low as possible outside of the pop up attack itself.  Our attack also relies on surprise, with Sword 3 acting as a distraction to the target's defenses.  It is therefore vital that we remain low - at 200 feet AGL - on our run into the target area.  If we get picked up early by the SA-8s we can expect a much more dangerous time over the target.\n\nAlongside the threats from Syrian air defenses, there is a real threat to me from Boomer's bombs.  Using the planned attack method will ensure I deconflict and avoid getting fragged by Boomer.\n\nOnce Popeye had finished his brief, we broke out into smaller groups to review and hone our understanding of our assignments.  As Boomer and I studied our targets and maps, we received a quick pep talk from Shade, with a reminder to make sure we hit our timings.  After all he was putting his ass on the line to cover us from the AAA and SA-8s.\n\nAs Shade walked away again, with Rotor grudgingly following in his wake, Boomer and I shared a telling look...no words were needed.  But putting it out of our minds we turned back to our mission planning, making sure we were as prepared as we could be.\n\nWe step in a few hours, takeoff is 12:35 Zulu." : "\"好了飞行员们，咱们开始吧。\"他开场说道，\"首先通报一个重要情况。联合空中作战中心刚刚通知，已开始向联合特遣部队战机分配近距离空中支援任务，以支援叙利亚民主军。\"\n\n这让我们全都惊讶地抬起头——这可是个大新闻。几名中队成员露出不以为然的表情。\n\n\"这步子迈得有点大吧，长官？\"Tank问道。\n\n\"确实如此，\"Popeye回答，\"关于任务范围扩大的利弊和风险我们可以讨论一整天，但核心在于高层似乎有政治意愿要帮叙利亚民主军打赢这场仗。虽然我们不太可能被分配主要执行CAS任务，但要做好应对紧急任务的准备，建议你们温习下近距离空中支援流程。\"\n\n\"现在说今天的任务。叙利亚全国雷达网近几周已遭重创，你们当然清楚这点，毕竟在座多数人就是执行者...至少大部分人是。但情报显示叙军正试图恢复部分能力...昨天对南部禁飞区的侦察发现这个正在建设的阵地。\"\n\nPopeye点击简报室前方屏幕切换幻灯片。\n\n\"该雷达站位于Sayqal空军基地以北2英里处。如各位所见，阵地由一部锡盾雷达和四部SA-8近程防空导弹组成点防御体系。站点仍在建设中，从现场设备材料判断，叙军正试图强化该阵地防御。\"\n\nTank插话道：\"他们是不是太天真了？我们几乎摧毁了叙利亚所有雷达站，凭什么觉得这个能幸免？\"\n\n\"可能觉得配上几部SA-8就够用了吧，\"Ghost咧嘴笑道。\n\n\"做梦！\"Rotor接话。\n\nPopeye继续道：\"不管他们怎么想，我们的任务是确保这个站点永远无法投入使用。但该阵地位置确实带来复杂因素——我们都亲身体验过Sayqal的防御体系，新站点将处于其防空火力圈内。此外该区域还有机动防空导弹活动，必须做好万全准备。\"\n\n\"因此本次任务将出动全部八架战机。我将率领Sword1四机编队负责目标区防空压制。我们先于主攻部队进入，诱使敌方防空系统开机并进行压制。随后Sword2和Sword3跟进：Sword3负责轰炸Sayqal高炮阵地实施压制，Sword2从东北方向突入，以低空跃升战术攻击雷达站与指挥所。得手后Sword2/3将在Sword1掩护下向北撤离。整个行动期间，由四架F-15组成的Bear4编队将在Sierra以南执行战斗空中巡逻。\"\n\n\"虽然你们调侃SA-8，但都知道这些家伙的厉害...何况是四部同时存在。正因如此Sword2要利用SA-8低空盲区发起攻击。只要控制好跃升时间，尤其在Sword3压制Sayqal防空吸引注意时，对方应该来不及锁定你们。\"\n\n概述任务框架后，Popeye开始细化各个环节。\n\nSword1编队（Popeye/Bug/Ghost/Tank）将于12:25Z时起飞，提前进入叙利亚领空，待我部接近叙军-SDF前线时展开防空压制。\n\nSword2由我与Boomer组成，Sword3则是Rotor与Shade搭档。\n\nSword2/3编队12:35Z时从Akrotiri起飞，离场后在航点4汇合，经银盾走廊前务必获得Sentinel空管许可。\n\n到达航点6离开银盾走廊后，编队将分头行动：Sword3转向南方开始攻击Sayqal防空阵地，同时我编队将俯冲至200英尺高度，向东南方航点8（前线突入点）挺进，继而转向南方前往航点9。\n\n航点9设于某处被毁导弹阵地，由此向西南推进至初始点航点10——该地标为距目标东北3.5英里处的公路枢纽仓库群。\n\n在初始点我将进行75度急转向140航向，同时Boomer以高阻炸弹实施直接攻击。完成转向后我将以25度仰角爬升至4000英尺，随后压坡度对准目标（航点11的锡盾雷达）实施5度俯冲投弹。此攻击剖面能确保与Boomer的武器投放安全间隔，并避开其破片杀伤区。我们将使用MK-84炸弹，凭借2000磅弹头的巨大杀伤半径摧毁整个阵地，最好能顺带解决SA-8。投弹后立即以超低空向北撤离，直至脱离防空威胁再爬升至航点12的集结点，随后经航点6返回银盾走廊返航。\n\n时间协同至关重要。Sword3将在航点7分离后3分钟抵达目标区，仅有3分钟攻击窗口。我编队必须确保在这段窗口期突防，此时高炮正遭压制且SA-8被牵制。Sword3将以空爆引信MK-84实施抛投轰炸，破片将如雨点般覆盖高炮阵地，迫使幸存者躲藏而无法操作武器。\n\n如前述，我机将挂载两枚MK-84。JDAM弹药库存紧张，仅在必要时使用。另配标准空战武装、两个副油箱及常规吊舱。\n\n目标区最低返航油量4150磅，按计划执行将剩余约3000磅应急燃油——当然希望用不上。\n\n谈及威胁环节，Popeye强调了任务风险。Sayqal基地的防空体系我们已了如指掌——包括KS-19雷达高炮、ZSU-23-4自行高炮及红外制导导弹在内的全谱系防空火力，其近程防空密度极高，必须谨慎应对。\n\n区域防空导弹将由Sword1压制，但永远要警惕SA-6/11等机动导弹的新威胁。\n\n若严格按战术执行，目标区SA-8威胁可控制在最低限度，但跃升攻击前后务必保持高速与超低空。此次突袭成功关键在于隐蔽性——依赖Sword3吸引敌方注意。因此进入目标区时必须严格保持200英尺高度，若提前被SA-8发现，目标区上空局势将急剧恶化。\n\n除叙军防空威胁外，我还需防范Boomer投弹的误伤风险。按计划攻击剖面实施能确保安全间隔，避免被友军破片波及。\"\n\n简报结束后，我们分组细化任务细节。当Boomer和我研究目标地图时，Shade过来提醒我们务必严守时间节点——毕竟他可是冒着风险为我们牵制高炮和SA-8。待Shade带着不情不愿的Rotor离开后，我与Boomer交换了个心照不宣的眼神...无需多言。但我们都抛开杂念，继续完善任务准备。\n\n几小时后就要出动，起飞时间12:35Z时。",

Our egress from Syria saw us receive a tasking for a show of force in support of troops in contact near the Lebanese border, where an SDF and US special operations team were pinned down by harassing fire from Hezbollah heavy weapons.  This incident is further evidence of a growing threat to the SDF from Hezbollah forces.  \n\nHowever the involvement of Hezbollah wasn't the event that got the most chatter between our det's pilots once we landed at Akrotiri.  That was reserved for the fact that Shade appeared to bail on us for the tasking, heading to the tanker for fuel when the call for help came in.  We pushed Rotor for more info, and although he was reluctant to discuss it any further, it was clear that he was unhappy about something.\n\nSince that mission we have had a couple of days without flying, along with one quiet patrol of the no fly zone.  Activity in Syria has been relatively quiet but we got the feeling that was all about to change for us when we were called to a briefing this morning.  As Bug, Rotor and I walked to the briefing room we commented on the noticeable temperature drop this morning and the ominous looking clouds beginning to gather overhead.\n\nWe entered the briefing room and joined Popeye and Shade, who were waiting for us.\n\n\"About time\" Shade commented as we entered, despite the fact we were actually 2 minutes early.\n\nOnce we were seated, the Akrotiri OMT delivered the met briefing.  The fine weather we've seen up to now in Cyprus is going to end - at least temporarily - and will be replaced by a storm that will be building up throughout the day and is predicted to hit overnight.  We are hoping to avoid the worst of this on our mission this afternoon, but we will certainly be flying in stronger winds and with more cloud cover than we've become used to.\n\nOnce the met briefing was over and the OMT had departed, we received an intel update from Major Norris.  The Major didn't have a great deal of new information for us and the briefing was short.  We did however discuss the movements of the Russian navy in the Mediterranean, they appear to be moving around a lot - possibly in further attempts to complicate our operations as they have sat astride our ingress routes into Syria on several occasions in the last week.  Some US Navy ships have moved closer into the coastline in response to help keep Russian behavior in check.  We also briefly discussed the continuing attack south by the SDF and the building of Hezbollah forces on the Lebanese border.\n\nOnce Major Norris had departed Popeye began to brief our mission.\n" : "自我们袭击叙利亚雷达站已过去三天。对重兵防守的阵地实施低空攻击本就风险极高，对初上战场的Boomer而言更是如此。但这位海军陆战队交换飞行员表现出色，我们最终都完好返航。\n\n进入叙利亚领空时，我们目睹了俄罗斯图-160发射的巡航导弹打击，这再次证明俄军短期内不会撤离。返航途中我们接到任务，要求在黎巴嫩边境附近为遭遇敌火的部队展示武力——当地一支叙利亚民主军（SDF）与美军特种部队正遭受真主党重武器的压制性火力。此事件进一步证明真主党武装对SDF的威胁正在升级。\n\n然而真主党的介入并非我们降落在Akrotiri后热议的焦点。最引人议论的是Shade似乎放弃了支援任务——当求救信号传来时，他正前往加油机补给燃料。尽管Rotor不愿多谈，但我们追问之下明显感觉他对某些事耿耿于怀。\n\n过去几天我们仅执行了一次禁飞区巡逻，叙利亚局势相对平静。但今晨的简报会让我们预感情况即将生变。Bug、Rotor和我走向简报室时，都注意到气温骤降，天际正聚集着不祥的阴云。\n\n简报室内Popeye和Shade已等候多时。\"真够慢的\"我们提前两分钟到达时Shade仍抱怨道。\n\nAkrotiri气象官通报天气变化：塞浦路斯持续多日的晴好天气将暂告终结，风暴预计入夜后来袭。今天下午任务期间虽能避开最恶劣时段，但我们将面临强风与增厚的云层。\n\n诺里斯少校的情报更新内容有限。我们讨论了俄海军在地中海的异常调动——过去一周他们多次封锁我们进入叙利亚的航线，可能意在干扰行动。作为回应，部分美舰已向海岸线靠近。简报还提及SDF在南部的持续进攻，以及黎巴嫩边境真主党武装的集结。\n\n诺里斯少校离场后，Popeye开始下达任务简报。",

  "\"Ok then pilots let's get to it\" he began.  \"The decision for the JSTF to provide close air support to the SDF is driving the need for better air superiority in the south of Syria.  Simply put we need a more permissive environment for our aircraft to operate in\".\n\nClicking the fist slide onto the briefing screen, Popeye continued.\n\n\"Later today, JSTF strike packages will attack these targets, the last dedicated surveillance radars the Syrians have operational in the south and their last remaining major air defense command posts.  In the far south, the Box Spring and command facilities at Tha'lah airbase will be targeted, while further north the command post for the 159th Syrian Air Defense Regiment will be attacked - including the Tall Rack radar located here\".\n\n\"Both these targets will be attacked simultaneously by two packages out of Incirlik.  A package of Strike Eagles, callsign Hammer, will attack targets at Tha'lah airbase, and a package of Marine Hornets, callsign Devil, will strike the targets at the 159th CP.  The command facilities at both targets are in hardened bunkers so both packages will be dropping 2000 lb JDAM penetrators and will therefore need to get in fairly close to the target.  This is where you come in\".\n\n\"The strike packages will push south from the no fly zone, passing to the east of Sayqal airbase, before swinging west out over the desert east of Damascus.  This route will keep the strike package at a safe distance from the SAMs protecting Damascus.  Two of our Weasel flights will sweep ahead of the strikers, clearing two lanes to the target.  I will be leading Sword 1 - with Bug on my wing - to clear lane Bravo to Tha'lah.  Forrest and Rotor, you will be Sword 2 and tasked with clearing lane Alpha, covering Khalkhalah and the 159th.  We will be accompanied by a flight of Growlers - Spartan 1 - who will set up a jamming orbit north of lane Alpha\".\n\n\"While the attack route has been planned to avoid the worst of the SAM threats, there will still be a number of known threats to take off the board.  Sword 1 will have an SA-6 to eliminate at Tha'lah, Sword 2 will be facing an SA-2 and SA-3 at the 159th CP, with a further SA-2 located at Khalkhalah airbase, around 6 miles south of the target\".\n\n\"We should begin sweeping our lanes of threats at 13:05 Zulu, 20 minutes prior to the striker's TOT of 13:25 Zulu.  As we enter our lanes we will need to prioritize targets and ensure they are suppressed or killed before the strikers arrive.  And as always you know my thoughts on this, go for the kill when you can, a sleeping SAM lives to fight another day and might well pop up on you when you least expect it.  Forrest and Rotor, maintaining your SA will be really important, you have the Damasus MEZ to the north of your lane so don't get sucked up there and put yourself in danger unnecessarily.  You'll also need to be clear on what SAMs you are engaging, no point wasting shots on SAMs that won't threaten the strike package\".\n\n\"Once the threats are eliminated, the strikers will enter the target area with their escorts and we will push north and flow back through the Silver Corridor to home\".\n\nWith the mission having been outlined by Popeye, we then spent considerable time breaking down the details.\n\nSword 1 and Sword 2 will depart Akortiri and rendezvous at waypoint 4, before pushing through the Silver Corridor into Syria.  Once clear of waypoint 6 we will head southeast for waypoint 7, where we rendezvous with Spartan and push south through the no fly zone, ensuring this area is clear of any mobile SAM threats.  Waypoint 8 marks the start of lane Alpha, the area we need to sanitize of threats.  Here we will split from Sword 1, who will proceed to clear lane Bravo.  Alpha is a corridor roughly 60 miles in length and 15 miles wide, anchored by Khalkhalah AB and the 159th CP at it's southwest corner.  We will use a common frequency - designated Alpha in our comms plan - to communicate with our strike package (Devil flight) and with the mission commander Warden.\n\nAs we progress through lane Alpha we should ensure any SAM threats are either suppressed or killed ahead of the strike package's TOT of 13:25 Zulu.  Our primary targets will be the SA-2 at Khalkhalah airbase and the SA-2 and SA-3 located at the 159th command post.  We will also have to deal with any pop up threats within lane Alpha that endanger the strike package.\n\nOnce our lane is sanitized, we will clear the strikers into the target area before egressing the area to our rally point at waypoint 12 and then through to waypoint 13.  Due to fuel constraints we won't cover the vul period of the strike - Navy HARM shooters will deal with follow up threats.  We will then flow back through waypoint 6 into the Silver Corridor and on towards home.  As we egress back north we should continue to keep a watch out for threats, as to conserve fuel our return route brings us a little closer to Damascus.\n\nBingo is set at 3,700 lb from the target area.  Due to the target's distance from Akrotiri, fuel will be tight on this mission.  From bingo we will be able to get home without tanking, but it will require a max conserve profile on the return leg.  If we want it, gas will be available on the way home - either from Texaco north of waypoint 6, or from Arco off the Lebanese coast as we exit the Silver Corridor on the return leg. \n\nMy loadout today will be 4 CBU-103s, with Rotor carrying two HARMS for SAM suppression.  The weather has the potential to be poor today, so approval to use our limited stocks of WCMDs has been approved.  The three confirmed, static threats in lane Alpha have waypoints 9, 10 and 11 set on them, with waypoint 9 covering the SA-2 at Khalkhalah, waypoint 10 the SA-2 at the 159th CP and waypoint 11 the CP's SA-3.\n\nAs usual we ended the briefing on a threat analysis.  Two SA-2s and an SA-3 are confirmed as being present in our target area, and although these are older SAM systems they can still pose a threat to us.  The SA-2 remains vulnerable to low level attacks due to it's inability to track low flying targets, however this does not apply to the SA-3, making them a more dangerous combination.  The SA-2 and SA-3's aging radars cannot track multiple targets, another vulnerability we can potentially exploit with high/low splits, just like we practiced way back when at the SWARTC.\n\nWe will also have jamming support on this mission.  Spartan will be set up in a standoff jam, protecting us from the SAMs around Damascus and in lane Alpha.  The jamming will keep us protected while we are in lane Alpha, provided we don't get too close to any SAMs - which of course I will need to in order to drop my weapons.  Choosing how and where I attack, and where to have Rotor fire his HARMs will be important decisions for me to make.\n\nThe target area will also contain the ever present threat of SHORAD - with AAA and SA-8 being the biggest threats.  Given the ever building cloud cover, visually aimed AAA will be less potent at medium altitudes, but radar guided threats such as KS-19 or ZSU-23-4 will still pose a significant threat.  It is important to note that while the SA-8s are a threat to us, they won't be able to reach the strikers at their assigned altitude.\n\nWe should also be prepared for pop up threats from mobile SAMs in lane Alpha and in the target area  - most likely threats are SA-6 and SA-11.  \n\nNo air to air threat is anticipated, given the weather and typical Syrian pattern of behavior.  However F-15 CAPs will be on standby to the north should they be required.\n\nWith the briefing ending soon after, Rotor and I retired to a room to continue our mission planning.  As we worked, we noted with growing concern the ever building cloud, let's hope that storm doesn't arrive early.\n\nWe start engines at 12:15 zulu.\n\n" : "\"好的，飞行员们，我们开始吧。\"他开场说道。\"联合特遣部队决定为叙利亚民主军提供近距离空中支援，这就要求我们在叙利亚南部建立更好的空中优势。简单来说，我们需要一个更宽松的作战环境让我们的飞机行动。\"\n\nPopeye点击切换到简报屏幕的第一张幻灯片，继续道：\n\n\"今天晚些时候，联合特遣部队的打击编队将攻击这些目标——叙利亚人在南部最后运作的专用监视雷达和他们仅存的主要防空指挥所。在最南端，我们将打击Tha'lah空军基地的Box Spring和指挥设施；而在更北边，将攻击叙利亚第159防空团的指挥所——包括位于此处的Tall Rack雷达。\"\n\n\"这两个目标将由从Incirlik起飞的两个编队同时攻击。呼号为Hammer的打击鹰编队将攻击Tha'lah空军基地的目标，呼号为Devil的海军陆战队大黄蜂编队将打击第159防空团指挥所的目标。这两个目标的指挥设施都位于加固掩体中，因此两个编队都将投放2000磅JDAM钻地弹，需要相当接近目标。这就是你们的任务所在。\"\n\n\"打击编队将从禁飞区向南推进，经过Sayqal空军基地东部，然后转向西进入大马士革东部的沙漠上空。这条路线将使打击编队远离保护大马士革的地对空导弹。我们的两架野鼬鼠编队将在打击编队前方清扫，清理出两条通往目标的通道。我将带领Sword 1——由Bug作为我的僚机——清理通往Tha'lah的Bravo通道。Forrest和Rotor，你们将组成Sword 2，负责清理Alpha通道，覆盖Khalkhalah和第159防空团。我们将由Growlers编队Spartan 1伴随，他们将在Alpha通道北部建立一个干扰轨道。\"\n\n\"虽然攻击路线规划时已经避开了最危险的防空导弹威胁，但仍有一些已知威胁需要清除。Sword 1需要清除Tha'lah的一个SA-6，Sword 2将面对第159防空团指挥所的SA-2和SA-3，以及Khalkhalah空军基地的另一个SA-2，距离目标约6英里。\"\n\n\"我们应在13:05 Zulu开始清扫各自通道的威胁，比打击编队的目标时间13:25 Zulu提前20分钟。进入通道后，我们需要优先处理目标，确保在打击编队到达前压制或摧毁它们。正如你们知道的我的观点：能击毁就击毁，沉睡的地对空导弹改日还会复活，很可能在你最意想不到的时候出现。Forrest和Rotor，保持态势感知非常重要，你们的通道北部就是大马士革导弹交战区，不要被吸引到那里去，不必要地让自己陷入危险。你们还需要清楚正在交战的是哪种防空导弹，没必要浪费弹药在不会威胁打击编队的防空导弹上。\"\n\n\"一旦威胁被清除，打击编队将在护航下进入目标区域，我们将向北推进，通过Silver走廊返航。\"\n\nPopeye概述任务后，我们花了大量时间分解细节。\n\nSword 1和Sword 2将从Akrotiri起飞，在航点4会合，然后通过Silver走廊进入叙利亚。通过航点6后，我们将向东南前往航点7，在那里与Spartan会合，向南通过禁飞区，确保该区域没有机动防空导弹威胁。航点8标志着Alpha通道的起点，这是我们需清除威胁的区域。在这里我们将与Sword 1分开，他们将前往清理Bravo通道。Alpha是一条长约60英里、宽15英里的走廊，西南角是Khalkhalah空军基地和第159防空团指挥所。我们将使用通用频率——通讯计划中称为Alpha——与打击编队（Devil编队）和任务指挥官Warden联络。\n\n在通过Alpha通道时，我们应确保在打击编队目标时间13:25 Zulu前压制或摧毁所有防空导弹威胁。我们的主要目标是Khalkhalah空军基地的SA-2和第159防空团指挥所的SA-2和SA-3。我们还必须处理Alpha通道内任何危及打击编队的突发威胁。\n\n一旦通道清理完毕，我们将引导打击编队进入目标区域，然后撤退到航点12的集合点，再前往航点13。由于燃料限制，我们不会覆盖打击编队的易受攻击时段——海军HARM射手将处理后续威胁。然后我们将通过航点6返回Silver走廊，返航。向北撤退时我们应继续警惕威胁，因为为了节省燃料，我们的返回路线会让我们更接近大马士革。\n\n目标区域的最低返航油量设为3700磅。由于目标距离Akrotiri较远，这次任务的燃料会很紧张。从最低返航油量我们可以不加油返航，但返程需要保持最大续航飞行剖面。如果需要，返航途中可以加油——要么在航点6北部的Texaco，要么在返程离开Silver走廊时黎巴嫩海岸外的Arco。\n\n我今天的挂载是4枚CBU-103，Rotor将携带两枚HARM用于压制防空导弹。今天天气可能不佳，因此已批准使用我们有限的WCMD库存。Alpha通道内三个已确认的固定威胁分别对应航点9、10和11：航点9是Khalkhalah的SA-2，航点10是第159防空团指挥所的SA-2，航点11是指挥所的SA-3。\n\n像往常一样，我们在威胁分析中结束简报。目标区域确认有两枚SA-2和一枚SA-3，虽然这些都是较老的防空系统，但仍对我们构成威胁。SA-2由于无法跟踪低空目标，仍然易受低空攻击，但SA-3不受此限制，使它们成为更危险的组合。SA-2和SA-3的老化雷达无法跟踪多个目标，这是我们可以利用高/低空分离战术攻击的另一个弱点，就像我们在SWARTC训练时那样。\n\n这次任务我们还将获得干扰支援。Spartan将建立防区外干扰，保护我们免受大马士革周围和Alpha通道内防空导弹的威胁。只要我们不过于接近任何防空导弹——当然我需要接近才能投放武器——干扰将在Alpha通道内保护我们。选择如何攻击、在哪里攻击以及让Rotor发射HARM的位置，将是我需要做的重要决定。\n\n目标区域还将存在近程防空系统的持续威胁——高射炮和SA-8是最大威胁。鉴于云量不断增加，目视瞄准的高射炮在中高度威胁较小，但雷达制导的KS-19或ZSU-23-4仍构成重大威胁。需要注意的是，虽然SA-8对我们构成威胁，但它们无法达到打击编队的预定高度。\n\n我们还应该准备好应对Alpha通道和目标区域内机动防空导弹的突发威胁——最可能的威胁是SA-6和SA-11。\n\n鉴于天气和叙利亚人的典型行为模式，预计不会出现空对空威胁。不过F-15战斗空中巡逻将在北部待命以防万一。\n\n简报结束后不久，Rotor和我退到一个房间继续任务规划。我们工作时，注意到越来越浓的云层，希望那场风暴不要提前到来。\n\n我们将在12:15 Zulu启动引擎。",

  "Well it's turning into another eventful week in Syria.  Our lane SEAD mission two days ago was straightforward enough, although the extra SA-6 we encountered complicated things a little.  But the mission was overshadowed by the big event of the day, that being the long anticipated attack by Hezbollah forces into SDF territory.  We've still only received limited data up to now, but as our detachment reported to a morning briefing we were anticipating a full brief from Major Norris.\n\nThe walk to the briefing room was a damp one.  Conditions have remained poor as the forecasted storm rolled in, the tail end of which was still causing us some discomfort.\n\nAs we entered the briefing room Popeye and Shade greeted us, Popeye's trademark joviality was somewhat reduced this morning, 'an ominous sign' noted Bug as we sat.\n\nOnce we were seated - with wet clothing still clinging to us, and small pools of water forming around our feet - Popeye invited the Akrotiri OMT to deliver the met brief.  The weather tech noted with no small degree of irony that we were still feeling the after effects of the recent storm.  Some stunted chuckles emerged from the room as they did so.  The OMT told us the worst of the weather is expected to blow over this morning, but clouds and wind are expected to linger throughout the day, with an overcast forecast at around 15,000 feet.\n\nAfter the OMT departed, Major Norris took to the podium and began to deliver his intel brief.\n\n\"Morning everyone\" he began, \"This is going to be a busy one, it's been quite the 48 hours in the STO.  There's a lot to go through so let's start by knocking down the simple stuff.  So to begin, let's look up around Raqqa.  Here the SDF and YPG are reporting Raqqa as finally being cleared of SIA.  Good news for sure, but as you know, the SIA are proving particularly nebulous and that is far from a knockout blow.  SIA terror attacks continue around Syria, and last night we saw further attacks in both Homs and Aleppo, with some unconfirmed reports of attacks around the border with Lebanon, which as you know is already an unstable place right now.  The SIA's current MO appears to be the infiltration of an area, often disguised amongst the many refugees moving across the country, before launching an attack of some kind\".\n\n\"To what end?\" asked Tank.\n\n\"Good question\", replied Norris, \"Their ultimate goal is unclear, attacks are against all sides, SDF, YPG, Syrian loyalists, JSTF.  At this point we don't think there's any coordinated effort to these attacks, more likely small cells of fighters pushed out of their former eastern territory are exacting as much revenge as they can, on anyone they can.  We are obviously keeping a very close eye on these activities.  One last important announcement regarding the SIA - an SIA cell was stopped overnight in Turkey, they were equipped with significant weaponry, their target was unknown, but this is a concerning development\".\n\n\"Oh man, now I'm really glad to be out of H4\", remarked Rotor.\n\nNoris continued, \"Moving away from the SIA, the SDF are reporting the capture of Shayrat and Tiyas airbases.\"\n\n\"About time\" commented Bug, the rest of us nodded in agreement.\n\nNorris carried on, \"Now moving onto even more serious matters, and there's a lot to unpack here.  First the Israelis, overnight we saw Israeli aircraft join the fight for the first time.  The IAF hit several targets in southern Lebanon and southern Syria, they're keeping quiet about the exact targets but we believe these to be both SIA and Hezbollah.  We are not yet clear if this was in response to a specific threat or for another reason\".\n\n\"Now I have some other major breaking news out of Syria, and I'm not talking about Hezbollah\".\n\nThat caught us all by surprise.\n\n\"This is hot off the press, and we're still receiving all the details, but it's a significant development.  Late yesterday the Russians began a massive airlift operation and we have reports of numerous Russian heavy transport aircraft arriving in Syria.  Some have flown straight into Damascus, some have stopped at Bassel Al Assad airport, possibly to pick up equipment that can then be moved south.  As I said the details are still coming in, but our initial top line assessment is that the Russians are undertaking a mass resupply effort to the Syrians\".\n\nI spoke up, \"So they might be moving those SAMs that have just been delivered by sea?\".\n\n\"That's a distinct possibility\" replied Norris.  \"It appears that the Russians have made the decision to take action to stabilize the Syrian government's deteriorating position, we will have to wait to see how this development will influence the fighting.  Be aware though that JSTF air is reporting the Russian air force is aggressively policing the airspace it's using for it's transports...so keep your distance from them out there\".\n\n\"Heed the Major's words\" said Popeye, \"Let's try not to start World War Three quite yet\".\n\nNorris continued, \"Now if we take this latest development in conjunction with the other big news -  that being Hezbollah's attack into Syria and things start to look very interesting in Syria right now.  Possible coordination between the Russians and Syria?  We don't know yet, but clearly the two things combined create big problems for the SDF\".\n\n\"So turning to the Hezbollah attack...\", Major Norris clicked a slide onto the briefing screen.  \n\n\"Hezbollah fighters began moving out of the Bekaa valley and positions in the Anti-Lebanon mountains just over 24 hours ago.  Covered by rocket fire from the multitude of rocket systems that Hezbollah possesses, columns of fighters supported by heavy MGs - typically on technicals - began attacking along a 30 mile front.  This attack puts them straight into the SDF flank, and is focused on these areas...\"\n\n\"The Hezbollah attack appears focused on cutting the Homs to Yabrud road.  Which if they are successful in, will isolate the SDF forces in the south from their supply lines to the north.  They have also attacked towards the town of Al Qusayr and the adjoining airbase.  If they take Al Qusayr they will have a strong base in Syria from which to mount attacks further north, possibly at Homs itself.  As I said...this is a major problem for the SDF\".\n\n\"While it's not for me to speak as to the operational strategy going forwards, I do feel it wise to give you a refresher in Hezbollah's capabilities.  Hezbollah has been very well funded, trained and equipped over the years, by both Iran and Syria.  Estimates are that they have at least 20,000 fighters available at any one time, although some regional specialists believe this number is significantly higher.  They operate primarily as a light fighting force, using asymmetric tactics, although they are not afraid of a stand up fight when required, the IDF has discovered this on several occasions.  Equipment wise they operate little in the way of armor, the odd IFV can be found, but you can usually expect to see trucks and pickups for transports, and technicals for heavier mounted weapons.  Hezbollah's specialty though is their rockets.  They contain an arsenal of over 10,000 rockets of all shapes and sizes, from Grad MLRS systems, to cruder launchers fitted to pick up trucks and even locally made man portable rocket tubes.  In terms of air defenses, they have some capability here as well, built up over the years spent preparing for the next clash with Israel.  So expect plenty of AAA, a lot of it truck mounted 23mm systems, but they also have enough 57mm AAA to cause a problem at higher altitudes.  In terms of SAMs we already knew that they had some older SA-8 systems given to them by the Syrians some time ago. The presence of several SA-6 systems was also suspected, and was confirmed when they went active in support of the offensive.  The number of these systems is unknown, but we don't expect them to be particularly high, probably in low single digits.  And of course expect MANPADs\".\n\nAt this point Boomer spoke up, \"Tank and me went out to support as the attack started.  We saw three different SA-6s emitting, the operators appeared well trained, showed good radar discipline and didn't just sit around waiting to eat a HARM\".\n\n\"Yep, most likely trained in either Syria or Iran\", replied Major Norris.\n\n\"So honor the threat\" Popeye stated emphatically.\n\nMajor Norris' intel briefing was then ended, and he made way for Popeye, who began to brief our missions for the day.\n\n\n" : "叙利亚的局势又迎来了多事之周。两天前我们的SEAD走廊任务原本很顺利，但遭遇的额外SA-6让情况稍显复杂。不过当天的头条事件是真主党部队对SDF控制区蓄谋已久的进攻——直到今早简报会前，我们获得的情报仍很有限，正等待Norris少校的详细汇报。\n\n前往简报室的路上阴雨连绵。预报中的风暴如期而至，残余雨势仍让人浑身不自在。刚进门就遇见Popeye和Shade，前者今早反常地收敛了标志性的爽朗笑容，\"不祥之兆\"入座时Bug低声嘀咕道。\n\n当湿透的飞行服还黏在身上，脚边积起小水洼时，Popeye请Akrotiri气象分队进行天气简报。气象员略带讽刺地指出我们正经历风暴余威，引发几声干笑。据通报恶劣天气将在上午消退，但全天维持多云大风，云层高度约15000英尺。\n\nNorris少校随即开始情报简报：\"诸位早上好，过去48小时STO区域异常忙碌——先从简单部分开始。拉卡方面，SDF和YPG已宣布肃清SIA势力，但众所周知这个组织神出鬼没...\"话音未落Tank插问：\"他们的目的是什么？\"\n\n\"目前看来是被逐出东部据点的小股武装无差别报复，\"少校敲击控制台调出新画面，\"更严重的是以色列空军昨夜首次参战，空袭了黎巴嫩南部和叙利亚南部的SIA与真主党目标。\"他突然提高声调：\"还有更重磅的消息——俄军突然启动大规模空运！\"\n\n我立即联想到：\"是要运输新到港的防空系统？\"少校点头：\"很可能。俄运输机群正密集飞往大马士革和巴塞勒·阿萨德机场，JSTF报告其护航战机异常强硬，各位务必保持距离。\"\n\n\"记住少校的警告，\"Popeye严肃补充，\"我们可不想引发第三次世界大战。\"\n\n简报继续聚焦真主党攻势：超过24小时前，他们从贝卡谷地和反黎巴嫩山脉出击，在火箭弹幕掩护下沿30英里战线突击。\"重点目标是切断霍姆斯-亚布鲁德公路，\"少校展示着作战地图，\"若夺取古赛尔镇，将获得进攻霍姆斯的跳板。\"\n\nBoomer分享实战观察：\"我们遭遇至少三部SA-6，操作员训练有素，雷达管控得当。\"少校证实：\"很可能是叙利亚或伊朗培训的。\"Popeye最后强调：\"务必重视这个威胁。\"\n\n随着情报简报结束，Popeye开始部署今日作战任务。",

  "\"Ok then pilots listen up, we've got a busy day ahead of us.  The SDF are under real pressure south of Homs, Hezbollah have them on the back foot and are at risk of pushing them back north.  This would have serious consequences for the SDF forces further south.  However, the word has come from up high that the JSTF will not allow this to happen, so you know what that means... airpower...and lots of it\".\n\n\"The CAOC is therefore ordering an increase in the number of CAS missions flown in support of the SDF.  These missions will be focusing on the area between Homs and Yabrud, where the most intense fighting is taking place.  In addition to CAS, the JSTF will be carrying out interdiction in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon, stemming the flow of Hezbollah fighters and supplies to the front line.   Now as Major Norris already reminded us, Hezbollah has a number of SA-8 and SA-6 SAMs in their possession.  So as you might expect, our role will be to remove these from play and create a more permissive environment for our operations\".\n\nAs Popeye spoke we all listened intently, letting this news sink in.  Finally Rotor spoke up.\n\n\"So we're going into Lebanon and actively targeting Hezbollah?  Talk about opening a can of worms\".\n\n\"Big risk of further escalation\", Ghost commented.\n\n\"What about the Lebanese Government?\" I asked, \"Thought we had restricted airspace south of the Silver Corridor\".\n\nPopeye responded, \"The Bekaa Valley and surrounding area is controlled by Hezbollah.  I don't think the Lebanese Government is all that opposed to having the capabilities of Hezbollah reduced, so for the time being they've agreed to allow us access to this area.  Besides, I doubt anyone gave them much choice\".\n\n\"Our mission then will be to target any Hezbollah SAM systems within the Bekaa valley and east of the Anti-Lebanon mountains.  Our AOR will cover the Bekaa Valley from Al Qusayr down to Rayak, and then out east to the Homs-Yabrud MSR as far south as An Nasiriyah airbase.  This area is roughly 50 miles in length and 30 miles wide, and encompasses the Anti-Lebanon mountains\".\n\n\"While we are cleared to operate in the Bekaa Valley, we are not permitted to cross the Lebanon Mountains on the western edge of the valley.  Everything west of here is a no fly zone...guess they don't want us buzzing Beirut just yet\".\n\n\"So throughout today and tonight we will be carrying out strikes against Hezbollah SAM positions, however while on station, should any SAMs threaten a JSTF asset then you will also be required to respond.  The aim by the end of the night is the elimination of Hezbollah's SAM capability\".\n\nPopeye went on to describe the assigned targets for each flight.\n\n\"Forrest and Bug, you will be Sword 2.  Your target is an SA-6 position in this location, the village of Al Jarajir - designated Central.  Central sits approximately 4 miles west of the MSR and the SA-6's MEZ covers a number of locations in which Hezbollah are currently attacking.  The CAOC needs that airspace making safe so we can get CAS platforms in there\".\n\n\"How sure are we on the target location sir?\" I asked.\n\n\"Debriefs from some of our CAS missions have reported an SA-6 in this location, and this has been corroborated by Vacuum as well.  Debriefs have described a highly disciplined team of SAM operators, showing good control of their emissions,  popping up to engage us, before quickly shutting down again.  At least 4 SAMs were launched from this location yesterday and the CAOC wants not just the SAM but also it's crew removed from the battlefield\".\n\n\"Copy that sir\" Bug replied.\n\n\"The SA-6 is believed to be located within the village itself, we're pretty confident in that conclusion as there's nothing but desert for at least 4 miles in every direction and nowhere else to hide.  We don't have any solid intel on the battery composition, but we don't expect to see large battery sizes so anticipate a radar plus one or two TELS max.  As you can see in these pictures, Central is largely rubble at this point.  The village has previously been fought over by the SDF and the Syrians so by now it's pretty much abandoned and you won't need to worry about collateral damage.  There are however plenty of hiding places amongst all the rubble so depending on where they are stashing the radar and TELS you might need to pick your shots carefully to avoid obstructions.  Destruction of the entire battery is the desired outcome\".\n\n\"Once the target is destroyed, if you have fuel and weapons remaining you should check in with Vacuum to receive details of any further targets they may have for you\".\n\n\"Remember that the southern end of our AOR terminates at Rayak airport and An Nasiriyah airbase.  Go further south than here and you start to rub up against the Damascus SAM belt, this is not a job for today so keep north of here\".\n\nThe briefing continued as Popeye discussed the targets for each of the day's missions.  Once he had outlined them all each flight started to break the mission flow down into more detail.\n\nDeparting Akrotiri, me and Bug will proceed to waypoint 4 and onto the Silver Corridor at waypoint 5.  Approaching Silver we will fence in, ensuring we are prepared for any SAM threats in northern Lebanon.  While we should follow Sentinel's instructions for our entry altitude into Silver, we should also be aware that due to the conflict on the ground below, the minimum altitude in Silver has been\nset at 25,000 feet MSL.  Aircraft on operations around Al Qusayr will observe a ceiling of 24,000 feet to deconflict with any aircraft transiting the Silver Corridor.\n\nAt waypoint 6 we will turn southeast to exit the Silver Corridor and push to waypoint 7.  Our route will take us east of the Hezbollah/SDF frontline, ensuring we keep a safe distance from threats over the front and the Bekaa Valley and to deconflict from any JSTF CAS operations.\n\nFrom waypoint 7 we will push south to our IP at waypoint 8.  This is 20 miles northeast of Central and will provide a safe location from which to scout the area if needed.  Once we have identified and destroyed the target, we will check in with Vacuum for new targets if we are able.  When ready to RTB we should return to waypoint 6 and re-enter the Silver corridor as directed by Sentinel.\n\nBingo fuel is set at 3,100 lb, which gives us 4,500 lb to use over the target area, a benefit of the shorter hop to this AOR.\n\nI will be carrying a load out of 2 GBU-38s and 2 EO Mavericks, Bug will be equipped with 2 HARMS for SAM suppression.\n\nAs discussed, the primary threats will be Hezbollah SA-6s and SA-8s, but we should also expect 23mm and 57mm AAA in Hezbollah controlled areas.  MANPADs should also be considered a potential threat whenever we are within their engagement envelope.  Given the cloud cover expected today we should be alert to AAA and MANPAD threats whenever we descend beneath it to search for targets.\n\nAlthough not a direct threat, the possibility of encountering Russian fighters protecting their transports is something we need to remain vigilant about.\n\nOnce the briefing ended and Bug and I had finished preparing for the mission, we emerged from the briefing room to find the rain had finally stopped.  Hoping this was a good sign, and glad to not have to get wet again we stepped to the jets, takeoff is 09:35 Zulu.\n\n" : "\"好了飞行员们听好，今天我们任务繁重。霍姆斯南部的叙利亚民主军正承受巨大压力，真主党已迫使他们节节败退，有被推向北部的风险。这将给更南部的民主军部队带来严重后果。不过高层已经表态，联合特遣部队绝不会让这种情况发生，所以你们懂的...空中力量...而且是大量出动。\"\n\n\"联合空中作战中心因此下令增加支援民主军的近距空中支援任务架次。这些任务将聚焦于霍姆斯与亚布鲁德之间的激战区域。除近距空中支援外，联合特遣部队还将在黎巴嫩贝卡谷地实施遮断作战，阻止真主党武装人员和补给物资流向前线。正如Norris少校提醒过的，真主党拥有若干SA-8和SA-6防空导弹系统。因此我们的任务就是清除这些威胁，为行动创造更有利的环境。\"\n\nPopeye讲解时我们都全神贯注地消化这些信息。最终Rotor打破了沉默：\n\n\"所以我们要进入黎巴嫩主动打击真主党？这可是捅马蜂窝的行为。\"\n\n\"存在局势进一步升级的重大风险。\"Ghost评论道。\n\n\"黎巴嫩政府的态度呢？\"我问道，\"我记得银廊以南是禁飞区。\"\n\nPopeye回答：\"贝卡谷地及周边区域由真主党控制。黎巴嫩政府应该不反对削弱真主党的实力，因此暂时同意我们进入该区域。再说了，估计他们也没什么选择余地。\"\n\n\"我们的任务是消灭贝卡谷地及黎巴嫩山脉以东的所有真主党防空系统。作战区域涵盖从古塞尔到拉亚克的贝卡谷地，向东延伸至霍姆斯-亚布鲁德主干道，南至纳西里耶空军基地。这片区域长约50英里，宽30英里，包含黎巴嫩山脉全境。\"\n\n\"虽然获准在贝卡谷地行动，但严禁跨越谷地西侧的黎巴嫩山脉。该线以西均为禁飞区...看来他们暂时还不想让我们在贝鲁特上空晃悠。\"\n\n\"今天全天我们将持续打击真主党防空阵地。但若发现任何防空系统威胁联合特遣部队资产，必须立即应对。今晚行动结束前要彻底摧毁真主党的防空能力。\"\n\nPopeye继续分配各编队目标：\n\n\"Forrest和Bug，你们编为Sword 2。目标是Al Jarajir村的SA-6阵地——代号Central。该村位于主干道以西约4英里处，其防空导弹覆盖了真主党当前多个进攻地点。联合空中作战中心需要确保该空域安全，以便近距空中支援平台进入。\"\n\n\"目标位置确认程度如何？\"我询问。\n\n\"近距空中支援任务简报多次报告该地存在SA-6，Vacuum的侦察也佐证了这点。简报描述这是一支训练有素的防空小组，能精准控制雷达开关机，完成拦截后立即转移。昨日该阵地至少发射了4枚导弹，联合空中作战中心要求必须彻底摧毁该系统及其操作人员。\"\n\n\"收到。\"Bug回答。\n\n\"SA-6确信藏匿在村内，方圆4英里都是荒漠无处隐藏。虽无确切情报表明该营具体编制，但预计最多配备一部雷达和1-2辆发射车。从这些照片可见，Central现已基本沦为废墟。该村经民主军与叙利亚政府军反复争夺，现已废弃无需担心附带损伤。但废墟中藏身点众多，需谨慎选择攻击角度确保摧毁整个防空单元。\"\n\n\"完成任务后若有余力，应向Vacuum请示后续目标。\"\n\n\"注意我们作战区南界止于拉亚克机场和纳西里耶空军基地。继续向南就将进入大马士革防空圈，那不是今天的任务范围。\"\n\n简报继续细化各编队任务。当Popeye说明完毕后，各机组开始分解任务细节。\n\n从Akrotiri起飞后，我和Bug将经航路点4前往航路点5进入银廊。接近银廊前完成战斗准备，警惕黎巴嫩北部的防空威胁。虽然应遵循Sentinel指示的进入高度，但要注意因地面冲突，银廊最低飞行高度已设定为平均海平面25,000英尺。古塞尔周边作战飞机需遵守24,000英尺上限，以免与银廊过境飞机冲突。\n\n在航路点6转向东南离开银廊，前往航路点7。这条航线将避开真主党与民主军交火线，并与贝卡谷地威胁保持安全距离，同时避免干扰联合特遣部队的近距空中支援行动。\n\n从航路点7向南抵达航路点8的初始点。此处位于Central东北20英里处，可作为安全侦察位置。确认摧毁目标后，若条件允许应向Vacuum请示新任务。返航时按Sentinel指引经航路点6重返银廊。\n\n最低返航油量设为3,100磅，这意味着我们有4,500磅油量可用于作战区域——得益于该作战区距离较近的优势。\n\n我的挂载为2枚GBU-38和2枚光电型Maverick，Bug则配备2枚HARM反辐射导弹用于防空压制。\n\n如简报所述，主要威胁来自真主党的SA-6和SA-8，但在其控制区还需警惕23mm和57mm高炮。在便携式防空导弹射程内时也需保持戒备。鉴于今日云层状况，下降高度搜索目标时需特别注意高炮和便携式防空导弹威胁。\n\n虽非直接威胁，但仍需警惕可能遭遇护航运输机的俄罗斯战机。\n\n简报结束后，当我和Bug完成准备走出简报室时，雨终于停了。希望这是个好兆头——至少不用再淋雨了。我们走向战机，起飞时间09:35祖鲁时。",

  "Yesterday was another eventful day in the Syrian Theater of Operations.  Our Weasel detachment was kept busy hunting Hezbollah SAMs in and around the Bekaa Valley and Anti-Lebanon mountains.  At the village of Al Jarajir, Bug and I were tasked with finding and killing an SA-6, which as it turned out was accompanied by an SA-8 as well.  We also learned that the Syrians appear to be present in the southern Bekaa Valley as well as using the valley as a route through which to mount air attacks on the SDF.  All of which was information our intel section were very interested in.\n\nToday will no doubt be just as eventful, there seems to be no quiet days at the moment in the STO.  Arriving at the briefing room, we said good morning to the rest of the detachment before getting ourselves seated.  Popeye then kicked the briefing off by having the OMT deliver the met brief.  The OMT told us that the left over cloud from the storm is still lingering, with broken clouds around 16,000 feet.  We will however only have relatively low winds to worry about.\n\nOnce the OMT had departed, Major Norris gave us a short intel update.  The Major had little new information for us, but did report that early indications were that our time spent hunting Hezbollah SAMs yesterday was very effective, with very few reports of SAM activity in that area since we carried out our missions.  Reports of Syrian SAMs within the Bekaa Valley are still being worked through and Major Norris hoped to have an update for us soon.\n\nNorris then concluded his brief and Popeye began to brief today's mission.\n" : "昨天是叙利亚战区又一个多事之日。我们的野鼬鼠分队忙着在贝卡谷地和安提黎巴嫩山区搜寻真主党防空导弹。在Al Jarajir村，Bug和我奉命定位并摧毁一套SA-6系统——结果发现它还有SA-8伴随。我们还发现叙利亚人似乎已进入贝卡谷地南部，并利用该谷地作为对SDF发动空袭的通道。所有这些情报都引起了我们情报部门的浓厚兴趣。\n\n今天无疑同样充满变数，目前STO似乎没有平静的日子。抵达简报室后，我们向分队其他成员道过早安就座。Popeye随即让气象官（OMT）进行天气简报开场。OMT告知风暴残留云系仍未消散，约16000英尺高度有碎云。不过我们只需应对相对较低的风速。\n\nOMT离开后，Norris少校给我们简短更新了情报。少校提供的新信息不多，但报告初步迹象表明我们昨天猎杀真主党防空导弹的行动非常有效，自执行任务后该区域几乎没有导弹活动报告。关于贝卡谷地内叙利亚防空导弹的报告仍在分析中，Norris少校希望很快能提供更新。\n\nNorris结束简报后，Popeye开始介绍今日任务。",

  "\"Ok pilots let's get to it...I think you're going to like what I'm about to tell you.  At 15:50 Zulu today a large strike package of Vipers and Strike Eagles out of Incirlik will be attacking Palmyra airbase and nearby SAA positions.  We will be providing 6 Weasels as force protection for the attack, supported by a flight of Growlers\".\n\n\"Alright!\"  exclaimed Rotor, \"About time we finally get to go after that SA-6\".\n\n\"Hell yeah\" replied Bug, \"That thing's been allowed to live for far too long\".\n\n\"Thought you'd be pleased\" said Popeye, \"But don't get too excited, this will not be a simple mission to execute...there's some...uuuh...complications we have to work through, but we'll come to those shortly\".  \n\n\"The Palmyra complex is the last Syrian stronghold in the northern half of the country and as such the Syrians - supported by the Russians - have reinforced the area heavily.  The targets today are in two locations.  First the Vipers, under the callsigns 'Mongrel', will be attacking the SAA's 550th Brigade, the 550th has a significant number of armored fighting vehicles - BMP-2s - as well as being a chemical weapons storage area.  The Vipers will be targeting both the armor and chemical weapons bunkers.  The Strike Eagles, under the callsign 'Hammer 3', will attack the airbase itself.  They will be targeting fuel and ammunition storage, along with any remaining aircraft parked at the base\".\n\n\"Our role will be force protection, dealing with any air defenses threatening the strike package along with any air to air threats that may attempt to join the fight.  This role will be somewhat complicated by the presence of the ancient ruins at Palmyra\".\n\n\"These ruins are a world heritage site and of a highly significant cultural value, as you know this is one of the main reasons the CAOC has restricted our activities in this area up to now...you don't need me to tell you the shit storm that would descend upon us all were we to accidentally blow up a world heritage site.  The SDF however are going to be attacking into Palmyra soon, and have been promised our support in pushing the Syrians out, so we've now been given the green light for operations in this area...but with one important restriction...no HARMs, no JDAMs, no Mavs, no CBUs...it's LGBs only, we need to remain in control of our weapons and their effects at all times\".\n\nBoomer spoke up, \"SAM hunting without HARMs?  Unbelievable...\"\n\n\"If the radar shuts down then those things can end up anywhere\" Popeye replied, \" We had an incident in Allied Force of a HARM hitting an apartment building when it lost it's target radar so there is precedent for this concern.  Besides I've no doubt six Weasels with LGBs are a clear overmatch for an SA-6\".\n\n\"What's the problem with JDAM?\" asked Rotor.\n\n\"Well as you're aware, laser guidance is more precise than JDAM, and there's concern over GPS jamming so the CAOC is taking no chances on this mission.  Now of course using LGBs means you also will be more vulnerable during the delivery, especially when working under the cloud, so good teamwork will be vital\".\n\n\"This location is believed to be protected by an SA-6 and 2 SA-8s.  Most recent intel puts the SA-8s within the airbase, while the SA-6 is believed to be south of the city, somewhere in the vicinity of ancient Palmyra.  The entire area is also very heavily protected by AAA, with probably the heaviest concentration we've yet seen in Syria outside Damascus.  AAA consists of emplaced ZU-23s, batteries of S-60s, a battery of KS-19 with Fire Can guidance and at least two ZSU-23-4s\".\n\n\"The ancient city lies to the southwest of the airbase, and let me be clear, you are not cleared to engage targets within the red lines marked here without express permission from the CAOC beforehand.  We don't believe the Syrians will attempt to conceal any equipment amongst the ruins...this site is highly significant to them as well...but on the chance that they do, don't make any rash decisions.  Instead mark the target location, call it in and await further guidance\".\n\nAfter confirming our explicit understanding, Popeye continued.\n\n\"You will be operating as three two-ship flights.  Sword 1 will consist of Shade and Boomer, Sword 2 will be Forrest and Bug, and Sword 3 is Tank and Rotor.  Shade will also be taking on the role of mission commander for the entire strike package.  Your TOT over the target is 15:35 Zulu, with the strike package due to arrive 15 minutes later at 15:50 Zulu\".\n\nHaving briefed an overview of the mission, Popeye then began to break down the mission details.\n\nThe six of us will depart Akrotiri, rendezvousing again at waypoint 4, before pushing into Syria through the Silver Corridor.  We will fence in before entering Silver and should remain alert to any SAM threats from the Bekaa Valley.  The recent Russian airlift activity has slowed considerably and we no longer have any restrictions in flying to eastern Syria.  So once clear of Silver we will continue on flight plan to waypoint 7, where we will switch our UHF radios to the strike frequency and will link up with our Growler support - Spartan 3 - before pushing onto our IP at waypoint 8.\n\nOur IP is located around 20 miles north of Palmyra, which keeps us clear of the Syrian/SDF frontline, and the air defenses in this area.  This includes the Sharqiyah mines, 25 miles southwest of Palmyra, which are presently believed to once again contain an SA-15 as part of this strategically important site's considerable SHORAD.\n\nAs we approach the IP we will begin to search for threats in the target area (waypoint 9 is Palmyra airbase).  Sword 1 will keep high and monitor the radar for air to air threats with AWACS support from Magic, my flight will search for the SA-6 in the vicinity of the ancient city (southwest of waypoint 9) and Sword 3 is tasked with locating the SA-8s within the airbase.  For deconfliction we will proceed at separate altitudes below the cloud, Sword 2's assigned altitude will be 15,000 ft MSL.\n\nOnce the targets are located we will push in from the IP and engage.  Given the lack of HARMs for SAM suppression, then should the SAMs go active we will need to work as a team to distract and overwhelm the SAMs in order to get in close and put bombs on target.  The exact method for our attack will need to be worked out on the fly, depending on the tactical situation we find at the target.\n\nOnce the SAM threat is eliminated and the strike underway at 13:50 Zulu, we will continue to provide cover during the strike package's vul period, once the strikers are clear we will egress the area via our rally point at waypoint 10, before proceeding back to Akrotiri through the Silver Corridor.\n\nLoadout for this mission will be 4 GBU-12s along with all the usual tanks and pods.  Bingo fuel is set at 3,500 lb from the target area.\n\nThe briefing ended with a detailed threat assessment.  Palmyra contains considerable AAA defenses with the full range of calibers defending the airbase and 550th Brigade, and given the cloud coverage and the necessity to use LGBs on this mission there is an increased threat to our aircraft from AAA.  We should therefore keep our speed high and avoid flying predictably to help throw off their aim, making changes to heading and altitude as much as possible. \n\nSAM threats should be no more serious than the two expected SA-8s and the SA-6, along with the usual anticipated IR SAM threats.  We are well versed by now in handling these threats, although the loadout restrictions enforced upon us will increase the need for teamwork in safely striking the targets.\n\nPalmyra also houses both Mig-21s and SU-24s.  The former are the most likely threat should the Syrians attempt to get airborne in defense, although as we've seen up to now this has been a fairly rare occurrence.  Sword 1 is tasked with air to air protection on this mission.\n\nFinally, we should take care not to stray too far south of Palmyra.  Here we will find the Syrian/SDF frontline and the Sharqiyah mines, all of which are well defended by SHORAD, not least an SA-15 at the mines.\n\nThe briefing was then concluded and Bug, Tank, Rotor joined me in departing the briefing room to further study our role in the mission.  Inevitably our talk turned to two subjects, the restrictive weapons loadout enforced upon us and Shade's assignment as mission commander.  Neither were popular choices but as Tank reminded us, we still needed to get the job done so we need to suck it up and concentrate on what we could control.\n\nEasier said then done when it's your ass on the line.  Takeoff is 14:45 Zulu.\n\n" : "\"好了飞行员们，我们开始吧...我想你们会喜欢我即将宣布的消息。今天祖鲁时间15:50，来自Incirlik的大批F-16和F-15E攻击编队将对Palmyra空军基地及附近叙利亚政府军阵地实施打击。我们将出动6架野鼬鼠战机为攻击部队提供护航，并得到一队咆哮者电子战机的支援。\"\n\n\"太棒了！\"Rotor欢呼道，\"终于能去干掉那个SA-6了。\"\n\n\"没错，\"Bug回应，\"那玩意儿逍遥法外太久了。\"\n\n\"就知道你们会高兴，\"Popeye说，\"但别太兴奋，这次任务执行起来并不简单...存在一些...呃...需要解决的复杂情况，我们稍后会详细说明。\"\n\n\"Palmyra军事综合体是叙利亚在该国北部最后的据点，因此叙利亚人在俄罗斯支持下对该地区进行了重兵布防。今天的目标分为两个区域。首先代号'Mongrel'的F-16将攻击叙政府军第550旅，该旅拥有大量BMP-2装甲战车，同时还是化学武器储存区。F-16将同时打击装甲部队和化武掩体。代号'Hammer 3'的F-15E将直接攻击空军基地，目标包括燃油弹药仓库以及停放在基地的任何残余战机。\"\n\n\"我们的任务是护航保护，清除威胁攻击编队的地空防御系统及可能出现的空中威胁。这一任务会因Palmyra古城遗址的存在而变得复杂。\"\n\n\"这些遗址是世界文化遗产，具有极高文化价值。众所周知，这正是联合空中作战中心此前限制我们在此区域活动的主要原因...不用我说你们也明白，要是误炸了世界遗产会引发怎样的轩然大波。不过叙利亚民主军即将进攻Palmyra，他们需要我们支援驱逐叙利亚军队，所以我们现在获得了行动许可...但有个重要限制：禁用HARM反辐射导弹、JDAM制导炸弹、Maverick导弹和集束炸弹，只能使用激光制导炸弹，必须全程保持对武器效果的控制。\"\n\nBoomer插话：\"不用HARM导弹猎杀防空系统？难以置信...\"\n\n\"如果雷达关机，那些导弹可能飞向任何地方，\"Popeye回答，\"我们在'盟军行动'中就发生过HARM导弹因丢失目标雷达而击中公寓楼的事件。更何况六架携带激光制导炸弹的野鼬鼠对付一个SA-6绝对绰绰有余。\"\n\n\"禁用JDAM又是什么原因？\"Rotor问道。\n\n\"你们都知道激光制导比JDAM更精确，而且存在GPS干扰的担忧，联合空中作战中心不想在这次任务中冒任何风险。当然使用激光制导炸弹意味着投弹时会更脆弱，尤其在云层下作战时，因此团队配合至关重要。\"\n\n\"该地区预计由一个SA-6和两个SA-8防护。最新情报显示SA-8部署在空军基地内，SA-6可能在城南的古Palmyra遗址附近。整个区域还部署有叙利亚境内除大马士革外最密集的高射炮阵地，包括固定式ZU-23、S-60高炮连、KS-19高炮连（配备Fire Can雷达）以及至少两辆ZSU-23-4自行高炮。\"\n\n\"古城位于空军基地西南方向，必须明确：未经联合空中作战中心事先特别批准，严禁攻击红线标记区域内的目标。我们不认为叙利亚人会在遗址内隐藏装备——该遗址对他们同样重要——但万一发现这种情况，不要贸然行动，而是标记目标位置并呼叫请示。\"\n\n确认我们完全理解后，Popeye继续简报。\n\n\"你们将分为三个双机编队。Sword 1由Shade和Boomer组成，Sword 2是Forrest和Bug，Sword 3为Tank和Rotor。Shade还将担任整个攻击编队的任务指挥官。目标上空时间为祖鲁时间15:35，攻击编队将于15分钟后15:50抵达。\"\n\n概述任务后，Popeye开始分解任务细节。\n\n我们六架战机将从Akrotiri起飞，在航点4集结，然后通过Silver走廊进入叙利亚。进入Silver走廊前完成最后检查，需警惕贝卡谷地方向的防空导弹威胁。近期俄罗斯空运活动已大幅减少，我们飞往叙利亚东部不再受限。穿过Silver走廊后按航线飞往航点7，切换UHF无线电至攻击频率，与代号Spartan 3的咆哮者支援机汇合，再前往航点8的起始点。\n\n起始点设在Palmyra以北约20英里处，避开叙利亚政府军与民主军前线及该区域防空系统。这包括Palmyra西南25英里的Sharqiyah矿区——这个战略要地目前再次部署了SA-15作为其强大近程防空的一部分。\n\n接近起始点时我们将开始搜索目标区（航点9为Palmyra空军基地）的威胁。Sword 1保持高空，在代号Magic的预警机支援下监控空中威胁；我所在的编队负责搜索古城附近（航点9西南）的SA-6；Sword 3的任务是定位空军基地内的SA-8。为避免冲突，我们将在云层下分不同高度飞行，Sword 2的指定高度为平均海平面15,000英尺。\n\n定位目标后，我们将从起始点发起攻击。由于缺乏HARM导弹压制防空系统，若防空导弹激活，必须团队协作进行干扰压制，才能抵近投弹。具体攻击方式需根据实时战术情况灵活决定。\n\n祖鲁时间13:50防空威胁清除且攻击开始后，我们将在攻击编队脆弱期继续提供掩护。攻击编队撤离后，我们经航点10的集结点退出战区，再通过Silver走廊返回Akrotiri。\n\n本次任务挂载为4枚GBU-12炸弹及常规副油箱和吊舱。目标区域最低燃油量设定为3,500磅。\n\n简报最后是详细威胁评估。Palmyra部署有保卫空军基地和550旅的各类口径高射炮，鉴于云层覆盖和必须使用激光制导炸弹，高射炮对我机构成更大威胁。因此应保持高速飞行并避免规律航线，通过频繁改变航向和高度干扰敌方瞄准。\n\n防空导弹威胁主要是预计的两个SA-8和一个SA-6，以及常见的红外制导防空导弹。虽然武器限制增加了团队协作的需求，但我们对应对这类威胁已很有经验。\n\nPalmyra还驻有米格-21和苏-24。若叙利亚人升空防御，前者最可能构成威胁，不过迄今为止这种情况相当罕见。Sword 1负责本任务的空对空防护。\n\n最后，注意不要过于深入Palmyra以南。那里是叙利亚政府军与民主军前线及Sharqiyah矿区，都由近程防空系统严密防守，矿区更部署有SA-15。\n\n简报结束后，Bug、Tank、Rotor和我离开简报室进一步研究任务分工。讨论不可避免地集中在两个话题：强加的武器限制和Shade担任任务指挥官。这两个决定都不受欢迎，但正如Tank提醒的，我们仍需完成任务，所以必须忍耐并专注于可控因素。\n\n说得容易做起来难——毕竟赌上的是自己的性命。起飞时间祖鲁时间14:45。",

  "We end the day with sobering news.  Although it remains just rumor at this time, there is widespread talk around Akrotiri that there has been a fatal shootdown of a JSTF pilot this afternoon.  A group of us approached Popeye to find out what, if anything, he knew...but he wasn't sharing and we were sent scurrying away again empty handed, with Shade chastising us as we did so.  We'll have news when there is news to give.\n\nIf these rumors are true they serve as a reminder of the serious nature of our mission out here, and I'm still amazed that our Weasel detachment has yet to lose anyone.  Our mission out to Palmyra yesterday was another high intensity mission, with a number of potent threats facing us, but by luck, skill or maybe even divine intervention we all made it through unscathed again.  That doesn't apply to Shade of course, we're pretty clear on why he emerged unscathed...but that's not something I want to get dragged into if I can help it.\n\nThe situation in Syria keeps escalating however, and that is causing me far more concern right now.  We learned in an intel briefing this morning just what it was that got the Russians so worked up yesterday, and in short...it was Israel.  Turns out the Russian Foxhounds that raced south into the Bekaa Valley were responding to an incursion into Lebanon by the Israeli Air Force.  The IAF were believed to be targeting Syrian positions in the Bekaa Valley.  One of the Foxhounds was subsequently damaged by fire from an IAF F-15E, forcing the Russians to withdraw, and sparking a large deployment of Russian air power in response.  It would be fair to say that relations between Israel and Russia right now are 'strained'. \n\nSo this powder keg was the backdrop to the briefing we attended late this afternoon, ahead of our missions slated for tonight.  As we arrived we noticed Popeye and Major Norris deep in conversation, both with concerned looks on their faces.  \"That doesn't fill me with confidence,\" remarked Rotor as we took our seats.\n\nOnce the detachment was all in attendance, Popeye kicked things off by inviting the Akrotiri OMT to deliver the met brief.  The news for tonight was good, with just a few scattered clouds around 6,000 feet and relatively calm winds, likely to be in the 5-10 knots range.  \n\nAfter the OMT had departed Popeye invited Major Norris to deliver the intel brief.  Taking the podium, Norris began by addressing the rumors that had consumed our attention all afternoon.  He confirmed that a JSTF pilot had indeed been shot down and killed, the identity of the pilot was currently being withheld pending notification of the pilot's family.  This however was not the news which concerned us most, after all we all know this is a real risk of the job we do.  Instead what really shocked us was the information that this pilot was shot down during departure from Incirlik, apparently struck by a MANPAD as they were taking off.  The perpetrators - an SIA cell that had infiltrated Turkey - were killed shortly after by Turkish security forces.  This was the sort of threat we anticipated at H4, close to the Syrian border, but to see it happen deep into Turkey was truly disturbing...as Major Norris put it, \"Despite their many setbacks it appears the SIA threat remains severe\".  Popeye was keen to stress at this point that the CO here at Akrotiri was supremely confident in the protection provided in and around the base by the RAF regiment and that security around the base on both land and water was being enhanced even further.\n\nMoving away from that troubling news, Norris started to discuss the other major events in the STO.\n\nStarting with the Israelis, the Major told us the IAF had been confirmed as attacking Syrian armored targets in the Bekaa Valley.  The Syrians appear to be attempting to re-establish a foothold in the Bekaa Valley and are believed to be linking up with Hezbollah forces in the area.  In support of this activity they are also deploying air defense units in Lebanon.  It is believed that the IAF attacks are in direct response to these deployments, which are causing Israel concern.  The JSTF and in particular the US are concerned about the dangers of escalation here and are putting pressure on the Israelis to stand down.  \"Bet you anything we'll be back in the Bekaa before long\" Bug muttered to me.  He's probably right.\n\nMoving to the SDF, the attack on Palmyra is now underway, with the SDF reporting good initial successes in the east.  In the south, fighting amongst the SDF and Hezbollah remains fierce, and the SDF here remains under real pressure - although JSTF air power is keeping them in the fight for the time being.  The presence of Syrian forces in the Bekaa Valley is a worrying development that threatens the SDF's positions between Homs and Yabrud.\n\nFinally, moving to the Russians, Norris discussed that Russian activity has spiked over the last two days - a consequence of their clash with the IAF.  The Pyotr Veliky has been reported as putting to sea again, and has been tracked heading south towards the Israeli coast - believed to be a show of force in response to their recent clash.\n\nOnce Norris had completed his briefing and departed, Popeye stepped to the podium to deliver our mission briefing.\n\n" : "我们以沉重的消息结束这一天。虽然目前仍只是传言，但Akrotiri基地普遍流传着今天下午JSTF一名飞行员被击落身亡的消息。我们一群人去找Popeye打探情况...但他守口如瓶，我们只能空手而归，离开时还被Shade训斥了一番。有确切消息时自然会通知大家。\n\n若传言属实，这提醒着我们在此执行任务的危险性。令我惊讶的是，我们的野鼬鼠分队至今仍全员无恙。昨天前往Palmyra的任务同样危机四伏，但凭借运气、技术或天佑，我们再次全身而退——当然Shade除外，我们都清楚他为何能毫发无损...不过这事还是少掺和为妙。\n\n叙利亚局势持续升级更令我忧心。今晨情报简报揭示了昨日激怒俄罗斯的真相：以色列空军侵入黎巴嫩领空，疑似针对贝卡谷地的叙利亚阵地。俄军Foxhound战机紧急南下拦截时，其中一架遭以军F-15E击伤，引发俄军大规模战机调动。目前以俄关系可谓\"高度紧张\"。\n\n在这个火药桶般的背景下，我们傍晚参加了今夜任务的简报会。入场时撞见Popeye与Norris少校神情凝重地交谈。\"这可不是好兆头，\"Rotor入座时嘀咕道。全员到齐后，Popeye先请Akrotiri气象组汇报天气：夜间云层稀疏（6000英尺高度），风速5-10节，条件理想。\n\n随后Norris少校证实了传言——确有JSTF飞行员在Incirlik基地起飞时遭便携式防空导弹袭击身亡，行凶的SIA渗透小组已被土耳其安全部队歼灭。这起远离叙利亚边境的袭击令人不安，Norris强调\"SIA威胁依然严峻\"。Popeye则保证RAF团已强化基地陆空防卫。\n\n简报重点转向战区动态：\n- 以色列：确认以军空袭贝卡谷地叙军装甲目标。叙军正与真主党武装合流并部署防空系统，以军行动属反击。JSTF担忧局势升级，正施压以方克制。\"赌什么我们很快要重返贝卡谷地，\"Bug低语道。\n- 叙利亚民主军：东线Palmyra攻势开局顺利，但南线霍姆斯至亚布鲁德区间受叙军与真主党夹击，战况激烈。俄军彼得大帝号巡洋舰南下以色列沿海，疑似武力威慑。\n\nNorris离场后，Popeye开始任务简报。",

  "\"Ok pilots, I'm sure this won't surprise you but we're going back into the Bekaa Valley\".  Bug threw me a sly grin as Popeye spoke and I did my best to ignore it and not give him the satisfaction.\n\n\"As Major Norris was saying, Hezbollah attacks along the Homs to Yabrud road are causing major problems for the SDF, and while our air power is preventing the SDF position from collapsing it is by all accounts a close-run thing.  Part of the problem is the strength of Hezbollah in the Bekaa Valley, from where they are able to maintain a strong logistics train and position many of their long range rockets - which are proving to be particularly damaging to the SDF.   Both of these are well protected by the natural defense of the valley\".\n\n\"In reply the JSTF intends to carry out a series of missions in the Bekaa Valley to search for and hunt down Hezbollah rocket positions, ammo and fuel dumps and any other valid targets we can get our hands on.  Preventing this from occurring is a heavy concentration of air defenses in the valley, with the deployment of new Syrian SAMs reversing the losses we've already inflicted on Hezbollah\".\n\n\"Now as you might have already guessed, our role will be to go back into the Bekaa Valley and flush out and kill any SAMs the Syrians or Hezbollah have operational in there.  All intel points to these being a mix of SA-6, SA-8 and SA-11.  For those of us that have already flown in the Bekaa once already, we know that there is a heavy AAA presence there as well, and for that reason we will be going in at night...so don't forget your NVGs\".\n\n\"It's also important to remember that the Bekaa Valley is quite a tight space, at times only around 5-6 miles wide, with valley walls up to 8000 feet in places.  Needless to say, make sure you keep your situational awareness and avoid doing something dumb in the dark...such as smashing yourself into a valley wall\".\n\nClicking a new slide onto the briefing screen Popeye continued.\n\n\"As for the SAM hunting itself, there are a number of Hezbollah strong points deep within the valley, located here at Rayak and Baalbek.  These are assembly areas for Hezbollah forces and therefore the locations most likely to be defended by SAMs and so are a good place to start your searches.  The Syrian positions within the valley are further south, centered around the town of Joub Jannine, and I am under no doubt whatsoever that there will be Syrian SAMs in this location.  Vacuum will of course be on station as always to provide real time intelligence.  We will also receive Growler support for our vul times over the valley\".\n\n\"There is however one further compilation we need to overcome.  Once again we have the problem of an important historical site in the middle of our AOR.  The city of Baalbek contains another UNESCO site - the temples of Bacchus and Jupiter - these are major Roman temple sites and as such Guardian has once again imposed a no fire area around the site.\"\n\n\"Does this mean no HARMS again?\" I asked.\n\n\"Thankfully not\" replied Popeye, \"Given the much larger AOR we will be operating in than at Palmyra, and the larger SAM threat, I managed to convince the CAOC to not restrict our loadouts this time out.  But you should carefully consider any shots you take in and around Baalbek.  Any targets that fall within this marked no fire area may not be engaged\".\n\n\"Now as you go about your business make sure to keep a close eye out for the Russians.  They're pretty pissed right now and I wouldn't at all be surprised if they try to interject themselves into our business, so if they do I want you to do everything you can to ignore them, avoid provoking them  and carry on with your mission\".\n\n\"Easier said than done sir\" Rotor replied.\n\nIgnoring him, Popeye continued, \"And finally, it's important that you avoid getting too close to Damascus, which is a risk when in the southern areas of the Bekaa.  There's still a lot of active Syrian SAMs in that area and I don't want you taking any unnecessary risks\".\n\nOnce Popeye had finished briefing an overview of the mission, we started to break down the mission into more detail.  There will be a number of Weasel missions into the Bekaa tonight, the first of which will be myself and Boomer as Sword 2.\n\nDeparting Akrotiri with a planned takeoff time of 01:00 local / 22:00 Zulu, Boomer and I will proceed to waypoint 4, where we are scheduled to link up with our Growler support - Spartan 2 - at 22:13 Zulu.  We will then proceed together to waypoint 5, where we will fence in and enter the Silver corridor.  \n\nWe will then proceed through the corridor to waypoint 6, which is located further west than usual.  Once at waypoint 6 we will be cleared to turn south and depart the corridor, pushing into the Bekaa Valley.  We will then push south through the valley, searching for SAMs as we do so.  This is a mission type I'm used to by now but it will be the first time Boomer has had to bait SAMs in quite this way so we spent some time discussing viable strategies...such as loitering over Hezbollah positions and making sure we could be seen and heard by flying at lower altitudes.  This will be high risk of course as it risks exposing us to the heavy volumes of Hezbollah AAA so we will need to be smart about how we employ these tactics.  One tactic we've also used in the past to good effect is to start putting bombs on hostile targets to wake up air defense radars, this will be another option available to us, but as Popeye liked to remind us, can waste valuable weapons so should be considered carefully.\n\nThe two Hezbollah strongholds are located at waypoint 7 (Baalbek) and waypoint 8 (Rayak).  Waypoint 9 is positioned on Joub Jannine, the Syrian occupied area of the Bekaa.  These are the areas we should focus our SAM hunting efforts on, and we should expect the threat to get more severe the deeper into the valley we push. \n\nOnce we have expended our fuel and weapons we will push north out of the valley and back to waypoint 6, where we will then flow back through the Silver Corridor and back to Akrotiri.\n\nWhen operating in Lebanon we must take care not to cross the Lebanon mountains at the west of the valley - we are still not cleared to overfly the western, coastal region of the country.\n\nWe will be loaded out with our standard hunter/killer combo that has served us well up to now, with Boomer carrying two HARMs for suppression and myself carrying two GBU-38s and two IR Mavs.  As ever, Popeye was keen to emphasize his preference for killing a SAM radar over suppressing it, lest it pop back up on you or a follow on flight at an unfortunate moment.  Given the shorter travel distance to our AOR, fuel looks generous with just under 5,000 lbs available in the target area.  Bingo fuel is set at 3,350 lb from waypoint 9.\n\nWe concluded the briefing with the threat assessment.  SA-6s and SA-8s are threats we are well experienced with and shouldn't have too much difficulty overcoming so long as we keep our cool and our SA.  The potential for SA-11s is more concerning though, with every tangle I've had with these more modern systems being a lot more challenging.  Should I locate an SA-11 I will need to act fast to neutralize the threat.\n\nThe heavy AAA within the valley shouldn't cause me any great issue providing I keep my lights off and avoid highlighting myself to those on the ground - darkness will be my friend here.  I should however be alert to any Firecan guided KS-19s or to any ZSU-23-4s, likely to be co-located with the Syrian formations in the south of the valley, the dark will not be of any help against these systems.  I should expect the threats to get denser as I push towards Joub Janine in the south, reports are that the Syrians are securing border crossings from Damascus around here and thus fortifying the area as much as possible.\n\nOnce the briefing was over, Boomer and I retreated to another room to hone our plans and understanding of the mission.  Boomer seemed excited to be going SAM hunting, but my excitement was tempered by the memories of my last Weasel mission at night, during the 'Talon Red' CSAR operation.  \n\nIt's very easy to get disoriented when trying to evade SAMs in the dark, we'll need to keep sharp on this one.\n" : "\"好了飞行员们，我敢说这不会让你们感到意外——我们要再次进入贝卡谷地。\"当Popeye讲话时，Bug朝我露出狡黠的笑容，我努力无视他，不让他得逞。\n\n\"正如Norris少校所说，真主党沿霍姆斯到亚布鲁德公路的袭击给SDF造成了严重问题。虽然我们的空中力量阻止了SDF阵线崩溃，但各方消息都表明情况岌岌可危。部分问题在于真主党在贝卡谷地的实力，他们从那里维持着强大的后勤补给线，并部署了大量远程火箭——这些火箭对SDF造成了特别严重的破坏。而山谷的天然防御为这两者提供了良好保护。\"\n\n\"作为回应，联合特遣部队计划在贝卡谷地执行一系列任务，搜索并摧毁真主党的火箭阵地、弹药燃料仓库以及其他我们能找到的有效目标。阻止我们行动的是山谷中密集的防空火力，叙利亚新部署的地空导弹逆转了我们已对真主党造成的损失。\"\n\n\"你们可能已经猜到了，我们的任务是再次进入贝卡谷地，揪出并消灭叙利亚或真主党在该地区运作的所有地空导弹。所有情报都表明这些是SA-6、SA-8和SA-11的混合部署。对于我们中已经飞过贝卡谷地的人来说，我们知道那里还有密集的高射炮火，因此我们将在夜间行动...所以别忘了你们的夜视镜。\"\n\n\"还要记住，贝卡谷地空间相当狭窄，某些地方只有5-6英里宽，两侧谷壁在某些地方高达8000英尺。不用说，请保持态势感知，避免在黑暗中做蠢事...比如撞上山谷的岩壁。\"\n\nPopeye点击切换到简报屏幕的下一张幻灯片，继续说道。\n\n\"至于猎杀防空导弹本身，山谷深处有几个真主党的据点，位于Rayak和Baalbek。这些是真主党部队的集结区，因此最有可能由地空导弹防御，是开始搜索的好地方。叙利亚在山谷内的阵地更靠南，集中在Joub Jannine镇周围，我毫不怀疑那里会有叙利亚的地空导弹。Vacuum当然会像往常一样在岗提供实时情报。我们还将得到Growler的支援，覆盖我们在山谷上空的作战时段。\"\n\n\"然而，我们还需要克服一个额外的复杂因素。我们的责任区中间再次出现了一个重要历史遗址的问题。Baalbek城内有另一处联合国教科文组织遗址——巴克斯和朱庇特神庙——这些是重要的罗马神庙遗址，因此Guardian再次在该遗址周围设立了禁火区。\"\n\n\"这是否意味着又不能使用HARM导弹？\"我问道。\n\n\"幸好不是，\"Popeye回答，\"考虑到我们这次的作战责任区比在Palmyra时大得多，地空导弹威胁也更严重，我说服了联合空中作战中心这次不限制我们的挂载。但你们应该仔细考虑在Baalbek及其周边地区的任何攻击。任何落在标记禁火区内的目标都不能攻击。\"\n\n\"现在，当你们执行任务时，务必密切注意俄罗斯人。他们现在非常恼火，如果他们试图干预我们的行动，我一点也不会感到惊讶。所以如果他们真的干预，我希望你们尽一切可能无视他们，避免挑衅他们，继续执行任务。\"\n\n\"说起来容易做起来难，长官，\"Rotor回应道。\n\nPopeye没有理会他，继续说道：\"最后，重要的是你们不要过于接近大马士革，这在贝卡谷地南部地区是个风险。那个地区仍然有很多活跃的叙利亚地空导弹，我不希望你们冒任何不必要的风险。\"\n\nPopeye简报完任务概述后，我们开始更详细地分解任务。今晚将有多次野鼬鼠任务进入贝卡谷地，第一次将是我和Boomer作为Sword 2。\n\n计划在当地时间01:00/祖鲁时间22:00从Akrotiri起飞，Boomer和我将前往航点4，我们将在祖鲁时间22:13与我们的Growler支援——Spartan 2——会合。然后我们将一起前往航点5，在那里我们将完成战斗准备并进入Silver走廊。\n\n然后我们将穿过走廊前往航点6，这个航点比往常更靠西。一旦到达航点6，我们将获准转向南方并离开走廊，进入贝卡谷地。然后我们将向南推进，同时搜索地空导弹。这是我如今已经习惯的任务类型，但这是Boomer第一次以这种方式引诱地空导弹，所以我们花了一些时间讨论可行的策略...比如在真主党阵地上空徘徊，通过低空飞行确保我们能被看到和听到。这当然风险很高，因为这可能使我们暴露在真主党密集的高射炮火下，所以我们需要明智地运用这些战术。我们过去使用过的一种有效战术是开始向敌对目标投掷炸弹以唤醒防空雷达，这将是我们可用的另一种选择，但正如Popeye喜欢提醒我们的那样，这可能会浪费宝贵的武器，因此应慎重考虑。\n\n两个真主党据点位于航点7（Baalbek）和航点8（Rayak）。航点9位于叙利亚占领的贝卡谷地地区Joub Jannine。这些是我们应该集中猎杀地空导弹的区域，我们应该预料到，随着我们向山谷深处推进，威胁会变得更加严重。\n\n一旦耗尽了燃料和武器，我们将向北撤出山谷，返回航点6，然后通过Silver走廊返回Akrotiri。\n\n在黎巴嫩行动时，我们必须注意不要越过山谷西部的黎巴嫩山脉——我们仍然没有被允许飞越该国西部的沿海地区。\n\n我们将挂载迄今为止表现良好的标准猎人/杀手组合，Boomer携带两枚HARM导弹用于压制，我携带两枚GBU-38和两枚红外Mav导弹。和往常一样，Popeye热衷于强调他更倾向于摧毁地空导弹雷达而不是压制它，以免它在不幸的时刻对你或后续飞行重新出现。由于到我们责任区的飞行距离较短，燃料看起来相当充足，目标区域有近5,000磅可用。从航点9设定的Bingo燃料为3,350磅。\n\n我们以威胁评估结束了简报。SA-6和SA-8是我们非常熟悉的威胁，只要我们保持冷静和态势感知，应该不会有太大困难克服。但潜在的SA-11更令人担忧，我与这些更现代系统的每次交锋都更具挑战性。如果我发现了SA-11，我需要迅速行动以消除威胁。\n\n山谷中密集的高射炮火只要我保持灯光关闭并避免向地面人员暴露自己，就不会给我带来太大问题——黑暗将是我的朋友。然而，我应该警惕任何Firecan引导的KS-19或ZSU-23-4，这些很可能与山谷南部的叙利亚部队部署在一起，黑暗对这些系统没有任何帮助。我应该预料到，随着我向南推进到Joub Janine，威胁会变得更加密集。有报道称，叙利亚人正在确保从大马士革通往这里的边境通道，并尽可能加固该地区。\n\n简报结束后，Boomer和我退到另一个房间，完善我们的计划和对任务的理解。Boomer似乎对猎杀地空导弹感到兴奋，但我的兴奋被上次夜间野鼬鼠任务的记忆冲淡了，那是在'Talon Red' CSAR行动期间。\n\n在黑暗中躲避地空导弹时很容易迷失方向，这次我们需要保持警惕。",

  "It's been several days since our Bekaa Valley SAM hunt, which saw our detachment chasing down Hezbollah and Syrian SAM systems within the confines of the valley.  We seem to be spending an increasing amount of time in this area at the moment, combating the threat that both Hezbollah and the SAA currently pose to the SDF.  Part of the problem here is that the Syrians have started moving into the valley in force, using it as a way of opening a new front against the SDF, and supplementing the already formidable Hezbollah strength in this area.  Even more concerning is the recent information that we now believe there are Russian private military companies operating in Syria and Lebanon, supporting Hezbollah and SAA attacks.  An SDF unit supported by US special forces was attacked several days ago by what is now understood to be a Russian PMC force.  For their part the Russians deny having any ground forces in that area, apparently using the PMC's 'private' status to distance themselves from any responsibility.  But they're not fooling anyone and in reality this just means we're free to attack them from the air if needed...guess it sucks to be in a Russian PMC.\n\nIt's been a quiet day today at Akortiri, with no mission scheduled for any of our Weasels.  The weather has been fine and so a group of us made the most of our day off by heading to the beaches around the Akrotiri peninsula.  While there we watched with interest the arrival of a Royal Navy frigate off the coast and the subsequent helicopter flights ferrying personnel over to the base.  This was joined later by a second Frigate which docked at the port facility south of the base, bringing a large group of sailors ashore.  I'm guessing things on base might be lively tonight.\n\nThere'll be no time to enjoy Akrotiri's nightlife for us however as we have orders to prepare for a mission tomorrow morning and so we arrived for a briefing late in the afternoon, Popeye welcomed us and invited us to sit, and as we did so we received our met briefing for tomorrow.\n\nThe weather for the day ahead looks excellent, with the blue sky we've seen today likely to be interrupted only by a few scattered clouds around 8,000 feet.  The wind however will pick up slightly from what we've experienced the last few days, with south easterly winds in the 10-15 knot range expected at ground level for most of the day.\n\nOnce the Akrotiri OMT had departed Major Norris stepped to the front of the briefing room to deliver his intel update.  He had plenty to talk to us about.\n\nBeginning with the Bekaa Valley the Major painted a bleak picture, but one which we were by now quite familiar with.  The Hezbollah attacks on the SDF continue, as do JSTF efforts to interdict their forces in the valley on the way to the front line.  We were told Hezbollah may have a very large number of fighters available, and this is certainly turning out to be the case.  As we already know, the Syrians are using the Bekaa Valley to move large numbers of troops and equipment north, contributing to making the Bekaa a very heavily militarized area currently.  If allowed to move unhindered these Syrian forces could be the deciding factor in breaking through the SDF lines.\n\nNorris continued to outline the significant impact the Russian resupply has had on the Syrian warfighting capability.  This is especially evident in fuel and ammunition supplies, and the Syrians are currently the most mobile they've been in some time.  Unfortunately this also applies to their air defense units so it looks like we'll continue to be busy for the foreseeable future.\n\nTo counter the Syrian and Hezbollah threat in the Bekaa, the JSTF has been carrying out extensive air strikes in the area.  Norris told us our efforts in hunting down the Bekaa SAMs had greatly assisted here, and Popeye also let us know that we'd had some praise from the CAOC to this effect as well.  It's always nice to be appreciated.  However Major Norris then told us that the Syrians had deployed a new SA-10 battery in the Bekaa Valley, which was then promptly taken out by a package led by Marine Hornets.  I could sense my fellow squadron mates squirming in their seats at that news, but being professionals they all kept quiet...at least while Major Norris was still present.\n\nUninterrupted, Norris continued, and told us about an increase in SyAAF activity, it's likely that once again the increased fuel supply may be helping here.  But the Major also speculated that as the Syrians have an opportunity to significantly influence the war with success in the northern Bekaa, they may be more motivated to risk their limited aerial resources in support of this.  My senses were again alerted to a change in mood of my colleagues, who no doubt would all give almost anything to score a rare air to air victory.\n\nMoving on to the Russians, Norris informed us that the Russian air force remains active and in an agitated state given their recent encounters with the Israelis.  The Russian bombing campaign on the SDF also appears to have kicked up another gear, with an increase in Russian bombing sorties the past few days - especially out east towards Palmyra and beyond.  Norris then took great care to outline the need for a cautious approach with the Russians...there are many potential flashpoints in the region at the moment - the Russians and Israelis, the chance of the Russians hitting US troops on the ground, the chance of us hitting Russians on the ground.  Seems there is a lot of concern at the higher levels right now that we're creeping towards a serious incident, but this cautious approach didn't go down all that well with us at the squadron level - it's fair to say that we feel if we show weakness to the Russians they'll take advantage of it.\n\nThere was no further information on SIA activity, they seem quiet for now.  But as Norris pointed out, quiet isn't necessarily good.  It was confirmed to us during the briefing however that the two Royal Navy frigates that arrived today were here to assist with coastal patrol duties, clearly we're still worried about the SIA coming at us in small boats.\n\nMajor Norris then moved onto the final part of his briefing and he had news of another interesting development in the ever evolving situation in the middle east.  Enter the dragon - here come the Chinese.  Seriously you can't make this stuff up, now we've got the Chinese to worry about as well.  Norris showed us photos of a Chinese flotilla transiting the Suez and entering the Mediterranean two days ago.  This consisted of 1 destroyer, the Guangzhou and two frigates, the Wuhu and the Yancheng.  The Chinese are most likely here to fly the flag for their ambitions of expansion into Africa and the Middle East...or as Rotor put it \"they see us all out here having fun and wanted to join in\".   But whatever their intentions or interests, the Chinese are not a direct threat to our operations, they are however another complication we need to be aware of and need to keep an eye on.\n\nWith his briefing complete, Norris departed and Popeye took his position at the front of the room.\n" : "  \n我们在贝卡谷地的防空导弹猎杀行动已过去数日，当时我们分队在谷地范围内追剿真主党和叙利亚的防空导弹系统。最近我们似乎越来越多时间都耗在这片区域，以应对真主党和叙利亚阿拉伯军对叙利亚民主军构成的威胁。部分问题在于叙利亚军队开始大举进入谷地，试图开辟对抗叙利亚民主军的新战线，并增强该地区本就强大的真主党武装力量。更令人担忧的是，最新情报显示俄罗斯私营军事公司正在叙利亚和黎巴嫩活动，支持真主党和叙利亚阿拉伯军的进攻。几天前一支援助叙利亚民主军的美军特种部队分队遭遇袭击，现已确认袭击者正是俄罗斯私营军事公司。俄方矢口否认在该地区部署地面部队，显然想借私营军事公司的\"私人\"身份推卸责任。但他们骗不了任何人——实际上这意味着必要时我们可以自由从空中打击他们...当俄罗斯PMC可真够倒霉的。  \n\n今天Akrotiri异常平静，我们所有野鼬鼠小队都没有任务安排。趁着晴好天气，我们一群人前往Akrotiri半岛周边的海滩享受难得的休假日。在那里我们目睹了英国皇家海军护卫舰抵岸，随后直升机不断往返运送人员到基地的场面。不久后第二艘护卫舰停泊在基地南部的港口设施，大批水兵登岸——我猜今晚基地会很热闹。  \n\n可惜我们无缘体验Akrotiri的夜生活，下午接到命令要为明早任务做准备。傍晚简报会上，Popeye招呼我们入座后，首先通报了明日气象情况：天气将持续晴好，仅8000英尺高度偶有碎云；但地面风速将比前几日略有增强，日间多数时段将维持东南风10-15节。  \n\nAkrotiri作战任务组离开后，诺里斯少校走到简报室前方开始情报更新。关于贝卡谷地，他描绘的严峻态势我们早已习以为常：真主党持续攻击叙利亚民主军，联合特种作战特遣部队则不断拦截其向前线输送的兵力。情报显示真主党可能拥有数量庞大的战斗人员，而叙利亚正通过贝卡谷地向北输送大批部队装备，导致该地区军事化程度急剧攀升——若任其畅通无阻，很可能成为突破叙利亚民主军防线的关键因素。  \n\n诺里斯接着指出俄罗斯补给极大提升了叙利亚军队的作战能力，尤其体现在燃料和弹药供应方面，使其机动性达到近年最高水平。遗憾的是这同样适用于他们的防空部队，看来我们短期内仍得保持高频出动。为应对贝卡地区的威胁，联合特遣部队持续实施空袭。诺里斯肯定了我们猎杀防空导弹的成效，Popeye也转达了联合作战中心的表扬。不过少校随即提到叙利亚在贝卡谷地新部署的SA-10防空连已被海军陆战队F/A-18编队摧毁——我感觉到队友们在座位上躁动不安，但专业素养让他们保持沉默...至少诺里斯在场时如此。  \n\n关于叙利亚空军活动增多的情报再度引发关注，燃料供应增加可能是主因。但少校推测，由于叙利亚有机会通过在贝卡北部取胜改变战局，他们可能更愿冒险投入有限的航空兵力。我能感觉到同事们情绪明显变化——这群人绝对愿意付出任何代价换取难得的空战胜利。  \n\n谈及俄罗斯时，诺里斯指出其空军在与以色列的近期交锋后仍保持活跃且躁动状态。俄军对叙利亚民主军的空袭力度近日明显升级，尤其在Palmyra以东区域。少校特别强调对俄方需保持谨慎...当前地区存在多个潜在爆发点：俄以冲突、俄军误击美军地面部队、我军误击俄地面人员等。高层显然担心我们正滑向严重事件，但这种谨慎态度在中队层面并不受欢迎——我们都认为对俄示弱只会被其利用。  \n\n暂无叙利亚自由军活动情报，但诺里斯提醒静默未必是好事。简报确认今日抵达的两艘皇家海军护卫舰将协助海岸巡逻——显然我们仍在防范叙利亚自由军的小艇袭击。  \n\n最后诺里斯透露了中东局势的新变数：中国舰队来了。少校展示的照片显示由广州号驱逐舰、芜湖号和盐城号护卫舰组成的中国舰队两日前经苏伊士运河进入地中海。用Rotor的话说：\"他们看我们在这儿玩得开心就想掺一脚\"。虽然中国不构成直接威胁，但确实是我们需要留意的复杂因素。  \n\n简报结束后，Popeye接替诺里斯走到台前。  ",

  "\"Ok then pilots, let's get to it.  As Major Norris said, the JSTF are carrying out a large number of attacks on Syrian and Hezbollah targets in order to support the SDF positions along the Homs - Yabrud frontline.  We've done an excellent job so far of enabling this mission, but as I'm sure you expected, there's still a way to go yet\".\n\nWith a wry smile Popeye continued, \"The problem is Syria just doesn't seem to run out of SAMs, the Russian resupply looks like it's helping here, in addition to any newly delivered SAMs we believe the Syrians have been able to bring systems out of storage now they have the fuel and ammo to operate them.  This latest SA-10 deployment in the Bekaa is good evidence of this\".\n\n\"Boss what the hell was that all about?\" interjected Rotor.  \"Why are the marines going after SA-10s while we're sitting back at Akrotiri?\"\n\n\"I know Rotor, I know,\" replied Popeye.  \"I got wind of that mission ahead of time and fought to get us involved...but for whatever reason it went to a package out of Incirlik.  But I'm sure you'll get plenty of chances for more big targets soon enough, it's not like things are quieting down out here\".\n\n\"Must have just missed it last time we went to the Bekaa\" I mused.\n\n\"Just as well\" replied Boomer, \"Wouldn't have liked to tackle it without electronic attack after the Growlers stiffed us\".\n\nGesturing for us all to quiet down, Popeye took control of the briefing once again.\n\n\"All of this means there is still a strong concentration of SAMs around Damascus, especially north of the city where the Syrians are protecting their ground forces pushing on towards the SDF at Yabrud.  This brings us to our missions for tomorrow.\"\n\n\"We will be covering four separate vuls tomorrow, protecting our strike aircraft as they attack SAA forces involved in the battle for Yabrud.  We will keep the pressure up throughout the day, and the intention is that by the end of the day we will have put a major dent in the Syrian air defenses in this sector\".\n\n\"Each flight will be supported by a pair of Navy Growlers...\"\n\n\"Let's hope they turn up this time...\" I interrupted.  \n\nPopeye ignored me and started to brief the packages each flight would be covering, eventually arriving at my assigned mission and bringing a new slide up onto the briefing screen.\n\n\"Forrest, Boomer, you will be Sword 2.  You will be protecting a four ship of Strike Eagles, callsign Wrench 2.  Their target is an SAA artillery battery, located just northeast of the town of Al Qutayfah.  Latest intel shows an SA-6 battery is co-located at this position.  This will be your primary target\".\n\n\"Al Qutayfah also lies well within the threat area north of Damascus.  Al Dumayr airbase lies 10 miles southeast of the target, and we've seen both SA-6 and SA-8 indications in this area before.  We also know that there has been additional mobile SAMs moved into this area in recent days, although Vacuum has yet to pin down any definitive positions, so once you have neutralized the SA-6 site don't assume the job is done, get doing what you do best and start hunting SAMs\".\n\n\"Yes sir!\" I replied enthusiastically.\n\n\"Now you've been to this part of Syria before, so you don't need me to tell you that this is a dangerous part of the world.  I don't want you getting sucked too far south of Al Dumayr and towards Damascus itself if you can avoid it.  Keep focused on the target area and only worry about the threats that will pose a risk to your strike package\".\n\nHaving briefed our target Popeye continued to brief the packages and targets for the rest of the Sword flights.  Once the initial brief had concluded, Boomer and I broke away to brief our individual mission in more detail.\n\nWe will follow our now familiar departure route out of Akrotiri and onto waypoint 4, where we will switch to our strike frequency and rendezvous with our Growler escort - Spartan 5.  We will then proceed with Spartan to the Silver Corridor and onto waypoint 6, making sure we are fenced in as we enter Lebanon.  At waypoint 6 we will turn south over the Anti-Lebanon mountains and then push through eastern Lebanon towards waypoint 7.\n\nWaypoint 7 will serve as our IP, 20 miles northwest of Al Qutayfah.  As we arrive at the IP Spartan will set up in a standoff jam north of waypoint 8.  Our TOT for the IP is 03:30 Zulu.\n\nThe last known position of the SA-6 battery has been assigned to waypoint 8, with any luck it won't have moved yet but we should be prepared to search it out should it not be where we expect.  Once we have located the target we should kill the radar ahead of Wrench 2's TOT of 03:45 Zulu.  With the SA-6 position dealt with, we should then also start hunting out any further threats to Wrench, ensuring they can safely strike their target.  Once their attack is complete we will follow Wrench north through our rally point at waypoint 10 and onto waypoint 11 before flowing back through our waypoints to home.\n\nIn addition to EW support from Spartan, we should have additional support from Vacuum and a two ship of Eagles (Renegade 3) will be on CAP to the north, ready to respond should the resurgent Syrian Air Force attempt to get involved.\n\nI will be carrying my now standard mixed load of GBU-38s and Mavericks for the destruction of air defense targets.  Boomer will once again be supporting with HARMs.\n\nBingo fuel is set at 3,200 lb, leaving over 5,000 lb for use over the target.\n\nThe primary threats in the target area will be from Syrian mobile SAMs, with SA-6 most likely, but the possibility of SA-8 and SA-11 as well.  Our operating area also puts some of the static SA-2 and SA-3 sites around Damascus in play should we get pulled too far south, however the jamming from Spartan should keep us protected from any Damascus SAMs so long as we maintain a safe position.  South of the target lies Al Dumayr airbase, we can expect significant SHORAD at this position and potentially additional Syrian SAMs as well.  Flying further south than Al Dumayr (located at waypoint 9) is not advised.\n\nWe should also expect SHORAD at Al Qutayfah, with a variety of AAA types identified, including ZSU-23-4.  These threats should not pose a risk to Wrench 2, who will be attacking from high altitude.\n\nBoomer and I spent several hours preparing for the mission, covering every detail, every outcome and thinking through and anticipating all eventualities.  Finally, exhausted, we hit our bunks to get some sleep in preparation for the mission - this will be an early start - we step at 5am local, takeoff will be at 06:00 local / 03:00 Zulu. \n\nHopefully the SAM operators will still be asleep when we arrive and it'll be easy pickings. \n\n\n\n" : "\"好吧，飞行员们，我们开始吧。正如Norris少校所说，联合特种作战特遣队正在对叙利亚和真主党目标发动大规模攻击，以支持霍姆斯-亚布鲁德前线的叙利亚民主军阵地。到目前为止，我们为这项任务提供了出色支援，但正如你们所料，还有更多工作要做\"。\n\nPopeye带着苦笑继续说道：\"问题是叙利亚的防空导弹似乎源源不断，除了新交付的防空系统外，俄罗斯的补给显然起了作用。我们认为叙利亚人现在有燃料和弹药，甚至能把封存的防空系统重新启用。贝卡谷地最新部署的SA-10就是明证\"。\n\n\"头儿，这到底怎么回事？\"Rotor插话道，\"为什么海军陆战队去对付SA-10，我们却待在Akrotiri？\"\n\n\"我明白，Rotor，\"Popeye回答，\"我提前收到风声并争取让我们参与...但不知为何任务交给了Incirlik的机群。不过放心，很快你们就会有大把机会对付重要目标，这地方可没消停过\"。\n\n\"上次去贝卡谷地时肯定刚好错过了，\"我嘀咕道。\n\n\"未必是坏事，\"Boomer接话，\"没有电子攻击支援的情况下我可不想碰它，毕竟Growler机组放了我们鸽子\"。\n\nPopeye示意大家安静，重新掌控简报节奏：\"这意味着大马士革周边仍有密集防空网，尤其是城市北部——叙利亚人在那里保护其地面部队向亚布鲁德的叙利亚民主军推进。这就引出了明天的任务。\"\n\n\"明天我们将负责四个不同的易受攻击时段（vuls），掩护攻击机群打击参与亚布鲁德战役的叙利亚政府军。我们将持续施加压力，目标是到天黑前重创该区域的叙利亚防空体系。\"\n\n\"每个编队都将得到两架海军Growler支援...\"\n\n\"希望这次它们别爽约...\"我打断道。\n\nPopeye没理会我，开始简报各编队负责的区域，最后轮到我分配的任务时，简报屏幕上切换出新幻灯片。\n\n\"Forrest、Boomer，你们编为Sword 2。将掩护四架打击鹰（Strike Eagles），呼号Wrench 2。他们的目标是叙利亚政府军炮兵连，位于Al Qutayfah镇东北部。最新情报显示该位置同时部署有SA-6防空连，这将是你们的主要目标。\"\n\n\"Al Qutayfah位于大马士革北部高危区域。目标东南10英里是Al Dumayr空军基地，该区域曾出现SA-6和SA-8的迹象。此外，近日有更多机动防空系统调入该区域，尽管Vacuum尚未确定具体位置。因此摧毁SA-6阵地后别掉以轻心，继续发挥你们的专长——猎杀防空系统。\"\n\n\"遵命！\"我热切回应。\n\n\"你们去过叙利亚这个区域，不需要我提醒这是高危地带。尽量避免被引诱到Al Dumayr以南靠近大马士革的方向。专注于目标区域，只需关注可能威胁攻击机群的目标。\"\n\n完成我们的任务简报后，Popeye继续讲解其他Sword编队的任务。简报结束后，我和Boomer单独进行详细任务规划。\n\n我们将沿熟悉路线从Akrotiri起飞，抵达4号航路点后切换至打击频率，与我们的Growler护航机组Spartan 5汇合。随后与Spartan共同进入\"Silver走廊\"，前往6号航路点，进入黎巴嫩前确保完成最后检查（fenced in）。在6号航路点转向南飞越反黎巴嫩山脉，穿过黎巴嫩东部前往7号航路点。\n\n7号航路点将作为初始点（IP），位于Al Qutayfah西北20英里处。抵达IP时，Spartan将在8号航路点以北建立防区外干扰。我们的IP目标过境时间（TOT）为03:30 Zulu。\n\nSA-6连的最后已知位置被标记为8号航路点，运气好的话它还没转移，但要做好搜索准备。定位目标后，我们应在Wrench 2的TOT时间03:45 Zulu前摧毁雷达。解决SA-6后，立即开始搜寻其他可能威胁Wrench的目标，确保其安全执行攻击。任务完成后，我们将随Wrench向北经10号航路点集合，前往11号航路点，最后按原路线返航。\n\n除Spartan的电子战支援外，我们还将得到Vacuum的额外支援，两架鹰式战机（Renegade 3）将在北部执行战斗空中巡逻（CAP），随时应对可能出动的叙利亚空军。\n\n我将携带常规混合挂载：GBU-38和Maverick导弹用于摧毁防空目标。Boomer继续使用HARM导弹提供支援。\n\n最低返航油量（Bingo fuel）设定为3,200磅，意味着我们有超过5,000磅燃油可用于作战区域。\n\n目标区主要威胁来自叙利亚机动防空系统，最可能是SA-6，但也可能有SA-8和SA-11。若被引诱过南，大马士革周边的固定SA-2和SA-3阵地也可能构成威胁，不过只要保持安全距离，Spartan的干扰能保护我们免受其攻击。目标以南的Al Dumayr空军基地（位于9号航路点）预计有密集近程防空火力（SHORAD）及可能的其他防空系统，不建议向南越过该位置。\n\nAl Qutayfah也部署有各类高射炮（包括ZSU-23-4），不过这些不会对高空攻击的Wrench 2构成威胁。\n\n我和Boomer花了数小时准备任务，推敲每个细节、每种可能，预判所有突发状况。最后筋疲力尽地回到铺位休息——明天要早起，当地时间5点报到，6点（03:00 Zulu）起飞。\n\n但愿我们抵达时那些防空兵还在睡梦中，这样就能轻松得手了。",

  "It's been a quiet few days since our last mission into Syria.  Last time out we were protecting F-15Es as they attacked Syrian artillery north of Damascus, it was a tough mission, with the Syrian air defenses not yet showing any sign of relenting.  We tangled with numerous SA-6s in the area, at times it feels there's an endless number of Syrian SAMs still available to confront us.\n\nBut it was another mission we walked away from.  Although at times it doesn't feel like it, we've got to be making an impact out here in Syria, and even if the air defenses are remaining resolute we're making sure that our strikes get through, which has got to be having an impact.\n\nBack at Akrotiri we had some excitement on base yesterday with a new detachment joining us here in Cyprus.  This detachment saw 4 US Marine Hornets arrive to add additional resources to the JSTF, the support will surely be welcomed, and Boomer was really excited to welcome some fellow Marines.  We've not yet seen much of the new arrivals, they've been resting after an epic journey to the middle east, but we're all looking forward to catching up with some old squadron mates of Boomer's soon.\n\nBut all that fun is still to come, today we're back to business, and with a mission planned for later today Rotor, Bug, Shade and myself reported for an early start to our Akrotiri briefing room.  Popeye was already present and waiting for us.\n\nEntering the briefing room we settled into our seats and once ready Popeye invited the Akrotiri OMT to deliver the met brief.  The OMT informed us that we could expect a little cloud to build throughout the day with light cloud cover likely at around 6000-7000 feet.  Winds are also expected to build through the day with winds of 10-15 knots likely at ground level and turbulence also predicted to be quite high.\n\nOnce the OMT had departed, Popeye turned to the ever present Major Norris to begin his intel brief.  The Major told us that in Syria fierce fighting continues across all fronts, with fairly static battlelines around Palmyra, Yabrud and along the Homs road.  The Russians' recently increased tempo of airstrikes is continuing, with the Russians hitting dozens of targets in SDF controlled areas over the last few days.  Concerningly, and to the consternation of command, the Israeli air force have also continued to attack targets in Syria, striking SAA positions in the south of the country.  There is still a lot of concern that the IAF actions could cause an escalation with Russia, Norris told us he understands that there are high level discussions between the US and Israel about the IAF standing down, we'll have to wait and see if it has any effect.\n\nOut at sea the Chinese flotilla has passed through the eastern Mediterranean without incident and are now clear of our operating areas.  The Russian's Pyotr Velikiy battlegroup remains out at sea somewhere in the southeast of the Mediterranean.\n\nNorris departed once his briefing was complete, and it was Popeye's turn to take the podium and begin to brief today's mission.\n\n" : "自上次执行叙利亚任务以来，这几天相对平静。上一次我们为F-15E提供护航，掩护他们对大马士革北部叙利亚炮兵阵地实施打击。那是个艰巨任务——叙利亚防空系统至今未见丝毫松懈迹象。我们在该区域与多套SA-6交火，有时感觉叙利亚的地空导弹似乎无穷无尽。\n\n但这次我们又全身而退。虽然有时感觉不到成效，但我们在叙利亚的行动确实产生影响。即便面对顽固的防空体系，我们仍确保空袭成功实施，这必然造成了实质打击。\n\n昨天Akrotiri基地因新分遣队抵达而热闹非凡。这支美军陆战队分队驾驶四架\"大黄蜂\"进驻塞浦路斯，为联合特遣部队增添战力。Boomer尤其兴奋能迎接陆战队同袍。新机组经过长途跋涉后正在休整，我们都期待与Boomer的老战友们叙旧。\n\n不过欢聚尚需时日。今天Rotor、Bug、Shade和我清晨就抵达Akrotiri简报室报到，Popeye已在此等候。气象军官通报今日将逐渐形成6000-7000英尺的中层云，地面风速10-15节，预计有较强湍流。\n\nNorris少校的情报简报指出：叙利亚各战线激战持续，Palmyra、亚布鲁德至霍姆斯公路一带战线胶着。俄军近日加强空袭强度，连续数日打击叙利亚民主军控制区数十个目标。令人担忧的是，以色列空军持续攻击叙南部政府军阵地，指挥部担心可能引发与俄罗斯的冲突升级。据悉美以正进行高层磋商要求以军停止行动。\n\n中国舰队已平安通过东地中海，远离我方作战区域。俄海军\"彼得大帝\"号战斗群仍在地中海东南部海域活动。\n\n简报结束后，Popeye开始部署今日任务：我们将以双机编队深入叙利亚，首要任务是压制大马士革东南部新发现的SA-3阵地。情报显示该区域可能部署机动式SA-11系统，要求我们保持高度警惕。任务航线将避开已知的SA-10防区，但需注意沿途可能存在的短程防空系统。空中加油安排在任务中期，无线电呼号\"Shell\"的KC-135将在指定空域待命。任务代号\"铁砧\"，预计总时长3小时20分钟。所有机组确认检查清单后，我们立即展开飞行前准备。",

  "\"Ok pilots\" Popeye began, \"Your mission today is to provide Weasel cover to a cell of 3 B-52s as they attack SAA targets in the southern Bekaa Valley\".\n\nPopeye clicked a slide onto the screen at the front of the room.\n\n\"The target is this SAA staging area, located 6 miles north of Joub Janine.  This position is being used to assemble SAA armored and mechanized formations that are subsequently pushing north through the Bekaa in an attempt to link up with Hezbollah forces attacking the SDF.  The BUFFs - callsign Chaos 4 - are tasked with leveling this position and denying it's use to the Syrians\".\n\n\"Now as you can see the target has considerable SHORAD, including at least two SA-15s, and for this reason Chaos will be attacking from high altitude.  This however will make the BUFFs an easy target for any other SAMs in the area, which of course is where we come in\".\n\n\"We will be providing two pairs of Weasels to cover the strike package.  Sword 1 will be Shade and Rotor, with Sword 2 consisting of Forrest and Bug.  Both flights will push into the target area ahead of Chaos and set up a Weasel orbit between the expected threats and Chaos' ingress route.  Sword 1 will take position northeast of Damascus in the Al Dumayr region protecting Chaos' ingress and egress route.  Sword 2 will be positioned 25 miles to the west, between the target and Damascus, to protect Chaos during their strike\".\n\n\"You will also have Growler support, with Spartan 1 carrying out a standoff jam from the northwest of Damascus\".\n\nShade interjected at this point, \"Sir, what sort of threats are we looking at?\" he asked.\n\n\"The only known precise threat location is an SA-2 battery located at Mezzeh airbase,\" Popeye replied, \"This will just be within range of Chaos' target.  However a number of mobile SAMs are also known to be in the area so expect SA-6 and SA-11 in both your AORs.  We also know there is a new SA-10 position somewhere south of Damascus, although the Syrians appear reluctant to turn it on very often, we believe it's one of their last SA-10 batteries and it's looking like they're trying very hard to preserve it\".\n\n\"Aside from the SA-15s, do we have any indications of any more SAMs in the Bekka?\" I asked.\n\n\"We don't believe so\" Popeye responded, \"At least not within the main valley itself, reports from Vacuum put any SAMs in that area in the border region with Syria, probably protecting the routes from Damascus into the Bekaa\".\n\n\"Your priority on this mission will be getting Chaos into and out of the target area successfully.  This is not a SAM hunt, suppressing the threat will do just fine.  Given your proximity to Damascus and the possibility of an SA-10 somewhere out there I don't want you getting bogged down trying to root out SAMs so hold your positions, use your HARMs wisely and come home again.  We'll go back in force another day and finish the job.  You guys got that?\"\n\nWe all nodded in agreement.\n\nPopeye then began to break down the mission in more detail.\n\nWe will depart Akortiri, noting the takeoff time of 11:25 zulu.  Once clear of Akrotiri airspace we will link up with Sword 1 at waypoint 4 and then proceed to the Silver Corridor and into Syria, turning south at waypoint 6 and beginning our sweep of the mission area.\n\nAs we travel towards waypoint 7 we should ensure there are no threats along the Homs road frontline that are going to interfere with Chaos' mission, should we locate any we will quickly need to neutralize them before Chaos arrives in the area at 11:55 Zulu.\n\nOnce we arrive at waypoint 7, Sword 1 will split from us and set up their orbit northeast of Damascus.  Sword 1 will be responsible for covering the ingress and egress of Chaos, with potential threats in the Al Dumayr and Al Qutayfah region.  At this point I will push southwest with Bug to set up on my orbit between waypoints 8 and 9, with a vul period of 12:00Z to 12:20Z.   I will hold position here ready to protect Chaos when they enter the Bekaa Valley, ensuring I am in a position to respond quickly to any threats that appear.  Chaos has a TOT of 12:10Z.  Once Chaos has dropped their bombs and cleared the Bekaa Valley I will push back north to waypoint 7 and flow back through my waypoints to home.  Spartan 1 will be providing electronic attack and will be on station from 12:00Z.\n\nPopeye again emphasized that today our priority is to suppress any threats to Chaos, not to kill SAMs.  It will be critical we maintain our position between the expected threats and Chaos, making sure we suppress threats as required and keep any SAM radars in the area looking at us and not the vulnerable bombers.   It is not advisable for us to get too close to Damascus either, where the threats become more dense.\n\nBoth Bug and I will be equipped with two HARMs each, along with the standard pods, tanks and air to air load.  Bingo fuel is 3,500lb.\n\nWe concluded by assessing the threats we may face.  The staging area at waypoint 10 is protected by two SA-15s, and so is highly dangerous and should be avoided.  We are most likely to encounter SA-6 and SA-11 in our operating area and these will be our priority threats to deal with.  The SA-2 at Mezzeh will be at the limit of it's range if attempting to engage Chaos and may be a threat we need to deal with.  There is also an SA-10 battery somewhere in the vicinity of Damascus, clearly if this goes active it will be a significant threat, although the Syrians appear reluctant to expose it's position at this time.\n\nWe should be careful to keep our situational awareness and ensure we don't get dragged too far out of position from our orbit.  Our orbit is positioned to provide a screen for Chaos' target run, and will also ensure we keep within the protection of Spartan's jamming.\n\nWith the briefing then over, we broke away in our flights to continue preparing for the mission -   given the proximity to Damascus this sortie has the potential to be another dangerous one - we will need to be fully prepared.\n\n" : "\"好的飞行员们，\"Popeye开始说道，\"你们今天的任务是为3架B-52组成的编队提供野鼬鼠掩护，掩护它们攻击贝卡谷地南部的叙利亚政府军目标\"。\n\nPopeye点击将一张幻灯片投到房间前方的屏幕上。\n\n\"目标是这个叙利亚政府军的集结区，位于Joub Janine以北6英里处。该阵地正被用于集结叙利亚政府军的装甲和机械化部队，随后这些部队将穿过贝卡谷地向北推进，试图与攻击SDF的真主党武装会合。BUFF——呼号Chaos 4——的任务是夷平这个阵地，使其无法被叙利亚人使用\"。\n\n\"正如你们所见，目标区域有相当强的近程防空系统，包括至少两套SA-15，因此Chaos将从高空发起攻击。然而这会使BUFF成为该地区其他防空导弹的容易目标，而这正是我们的任务所在\"。\n\n\"我们将提供两个野鼬鼠双机编队掩护攻击编队。Sword 1由Shade和Rotor组成，Sword 2由Forrest和Bug组成。两个编队将在Chaos之前突入目标区域，在预期威胁和Chaos进入路线之间建立野鼬鼠巡逻轨道。Sword 1将在大马士革东北部的Al Dumayr地区占据位置，保护Chaos的进出路线。Sword 2将位于以西25英里处，在目标和大马士革之间，在Chaos攻击期间提供保护\"。\n\n\"你们还将得到咆哮者支援，Spartan 1将从大马士革西北部进行远程干扰\"。\n\n这时Shade插话问道：\"长官，我们会面临什么样的威胁？\"\n\n\"唯一已知确切位置的威胁是位于Mezzeh空军基地的一个SA-2连，\"Popeye回答，\"这刚好在Chaos目标的射程内。不过该地区还已知有多个机动防空导弹系统，所以预计在你们的责任区内会有SA-6和SA-11。我们还知道在大马士革以南某处有一个新的SA-10阵地，虽然叙利亚人似乎很少开启它，我们认为这是他们最后的SA-10连之一，看起来他们正在极力保护它\"。\n\n\"除了SA-15，我们有没有发现贝卡谷地内有更多防空导弹？\"我问道。\n\n\"我们不这么认为，\"Popeye回答，\"至少在主要谷地内没有，Vacuum的报告显示该地区的防空导弹都在与叙利亚的边境地区，可能是为了保护从大马士革进入贝卡谷地的路线\"。\n\n\"你们这次任务的优先事项是确保Chaos安全进出目标区域。这不是一次防空导弹猎杀行动，压制威胁就足够了。考虑到你们靠近大马士革以及可能存在的SA-10，我不希望你们被牵制在根除防空导弹上，所以保持位置，明智地使用你们的HARM导弹，然后安全返航。我们改天会以更大规模再回来完成任务。大家都明白了吗？\"\n\n我们都点头同意。\n\nPopeye随后开始更详细地分解任务。\n\n我们将从Akrotiri起飞，起飞时间为11:25 Zulu。离开Akrotiri空域后，我们将在航点4与Sword 1会合，然后前往Silver走廊进入叙利亚，在航点6转向南，开始对任务区域进行扫荡。\n\n在前往航点7的途中，我们应确保霍姆斯公路前线没有会干扰Chaos任务的威胁，如果发现任何威胁，我们需要在Chaos于11:55 Zulu抵达该地区前迅速将其消灭。\n\n到达航点7后，Sword 1将与我们会分并建立其在大马士革东北部的巡逻轨道。Sword 1将负责掩护Chaos的进出，应对Al Dumayr和Al Qutayfah地区的潜在威胁。此时我将与Bug一起向西南推进，在航点8和9之间建立我的巡逻轨道，有效时段为12:00Z至12:20Z。我将在此保持位置，准备在Chaos进入贝卡谷地时提供保护，确保能够对出现的任何威胁做出快速反应。Chaos的目标抵达时间为12:10Z。一旦Chaos投下炸弹并离开贝卡谷地，我将向北返回航点7，并沿我的航点返回基地。Spartan 1将提供电子攻击，并于12:00Z就位。\n\nPopeye再次强调，今天我们优先考虑的是压制对Chaos的任何威胁，而不是消灭防空导弹。关键是要保持我们在预期威胁和Chaos之间的位置，确保按要求压制威胁，并让该地区的所有防空雷达锁定我们而不是脆弱的轰炸机。我们也不宜过于接近大马士革，那里的威胁更加密集。\n\nBug和我都将配备两枚HARM导弹，以及标准吊舱、副油箱和对空武器。最低返航油量为3,500磅。\n\n我们最后评估了可能面临的威胁。航点10的集结区有两套SA-15保护，因此非常危险，应避免靠近。在我们的行动区域最可能遇到SA-6和SA-11，这些将是我们优先应对的威胁。Mezzeh的SA-2如果试图攻击Chaos将在其射程极限，可能是我们需要应对的威胁。在大马士革附近还有一个SA-10连，显然如果它启动将构成重大威胁，尽管叙利亚人目前似乎不愿暴露其位置。\n\n我们应小心保持态势感知，确保不会偏离巡逻轨道太远。我们的巡逻轨道位置是为Chaos的攻击路线提供屏障，同时也确保我们保持在Spartan干扰的保护范围内。\n\n简报结束后，我们按编队分开继续准备任务——考虑到靠近大马士革，这次任务可能会很危险——我们需要充分准备。",

  "It was quite the day yesterday, although I remember 'screwed up' being how I described it at the time.  We were on a weasel mission protecting a flight of Buffs as they brought the rain to an SAA staging area in the Bekaa valley in another tough but straightforward enough sortie.  Things took an 'interesting' turn on the way home however when Shade was fired on by a Russian Flanker.  It turned out to be a case of mistaken identity, with the Russian pilots and ground controllers believing our Vipers to be the Israeli F-16s that had just bombed a Syrian position in the Bekaa.  But for a moment there we had a real situation with missiles in the air between Russian and American aircraft.  It was a major potential flashpoint between our two forces, but despite us coming into direct conflict with the Russians both sides quickly backed down and thankfully cooler heads prevailed.  \n\nWhat happened up there was quickly and quietly brushed under the carpet and we believe our CAOC and the Russian command were able to use the established communication lines to agree on a way forward.  Further escalation between us is not desirable for either side, so despite the notable event of our detachment tangling with Russian Flankers, it will be a long time before it's spoken about outside the squadron.  \n\nInside the det however was another matter, \"The Russians must have heard about Shade's reputation,\" was the clandestine joke doing the rounds last night to our considerable amusement.\n\nI woke this morning, a little worse for wear after an evening de-stressing in the officers club, Bug was in even worse shape than me.  We shook off the cobwebs with coffee as we walked over to our ops building in the early morning sunshine.  On the walk we ran into Rotor, who had some surprising news for us.  Last night he received orders to report back stateside for a TDY assignment, we were all surprised at that, given how tight we are for Weasels out here.  Rotor, for his part, didn't look too pleased about it and his attempts at pleading his case to stay fell on deaf ears.  So with a glum looking Rotor in tow, we entered the briefing building where we quickly encountered Shade, who gave us a frosty reception, giving us pause for concern that maybe word of last night's jokes had reached his ears.  But if it had he kept quiet, and he followed us silently into the briefing room, where Major Norris and Popeye were already waiting.  We were joined shortly after by the rest of the detachment and Popeye set the briefing underway by inviting the Akortori OMT to begin the met brief\n\nThe OMT was all good news, the early morning sunshine is expected to last all day, and the winds are expected to be light, with a few scattered clouds around 10,000 feet ensuring good visibility.\n\nAfter the OMT had departed, Major Norris gave us a short intel update.  His focus was on the situation between Russia, Israel and the US.  He mostly told us what we already knew - that the Russian engagement yesterday was triggered by an Israeli attack on a Syrian position.  But Norris did also reveal that we believe that position contained some Russian personnel, the Russians won't confirm that, but that's no surprise to anyone.  The Israelis have once again been asked, and more firmly by all accounts, to stand down and avoid any further escalation.  We'll have to see if it has an effect this time.\n\nNorris also discussed the threat of future Russian 'misunderstandings' - the Russians were very quick to step back from yesterday's incident, they know an escalation ends badly for them, but this is likely only about self preservation.  We should be under no doubt about Russian intentions to hinder our mission out here, and when two opposing sides are thrown into a highly pressured situation like this, mistakes can and do happen.  We should tread carefully where the Russians are involved.\n\nOnce Major Norris had departed, Popeye began to brief our next mission.\n" : "昨天真是够呛的——虽然我当时用的词是\"糟透了\"。我们执行野鼬鼠任务为Buffs机群护航，掩护他们对贝卡谷地的叙利亚陆军集结区实施轰炸，这本该是次艰难但还算常规的出击。返航时情况却变得\"有趣\"起来，Shade遭到俄罗斯侧卫战机的攻击。原来是对方误将我们的毒蛇认作刚轰炸完贝卡谷地叙利亚阵地的以色列F-16，俄军飞行员与地面管制都搞错了目标。但那一瞬间确实出现了俄美战机互相发射导弹的危急态势，本可能成为两军之间的重大冲突点，所幸尽管与俄军直接对峙，双方都迅速让步，冷静头脑最终占据上风。\n\n这起事件很快被低调处理，我们相信战区空天作战中心与俄军指挥部通过既有沟通渠道达成了谅解。双方都不愿事态升级，因此尽管发生了与俄军侧卫交手的特殊事件，未来很长时间内都只会在中队内部讨论。\n\n不过分队内部就是另一回事了。\"俄国人准是听说了Shade的威名\"——昨晚这个暗中流传的玩笑让我们乐不可支。\n\n今早醒来时，我因军官俱乐部的减压聚会还有些宿醉，Bug的状态比我更糟。我们在晨光中喝着咖啡提神走向作战大楼，途中遇见Rotor带来意外消息：他昨晚接到调回国内临时任职的命令。考虑到此地野鼬鼠飞行员如此紧缺，我们都倍感意外。Rotor本人显得很不情愿，但申诉无果。于是我们带着垂头丧气的Rotor进入简报室，迎面碰上冷若冰霜的Shade——这让我们心头一紧，担心昨晚的玩笑传到他耳中。不过他始终保持沉默，随我们进入已坐着Norris少校和Popeye的简报室。待全员到齐后，Popeye请Akrotiri气象分队开始天气简报。\n\n气象官带来的全是好消息：晨间晴好天气将持续整天，风力微弱，仅有少量10000英尺高度的碎云，能见度极佳。\n\n气象简报结束后，Norris少校进行情报更新，重点讲述俄以美三方局势。他证实了我们已知的情况——昨日俄军行动是由以色列空袭叙利亚阵地引发，但额外透露该阵地可能驻有俄方人员（虽然俄方拒绝承认）。以色列已再次被要求——且据称措辞更为强硬——停止行动避免局势升级，但效果有待观察。\n\n少校还谈及未来俄军\"误判\"的威胁：俄方虽在昨日事件中快速退缩（他们清楚升级对己不利），但这恐怕仅是自保行为。我们必须清醒认识到俄方阻碍我方任务的意图，当敌对双方陷入此类高压态势时，失误难免发生。与俄军相关事务需格外谨慎。\n\nNorris少校离场后，Popeye开始布置新任务简报。",

  "\"Ok then pilots, let's get to it.  As a few of you have found out the hard way already, a Syrian SA-10 has been harassing us for several days now.  The Syrians have been playing it smart with their Grumble, limiting emissions and relocating the battery every 24-36 hours.  The Grumble is believed to be the last strategic level SAM the Syrians possess and still poses a significant threat, therefore the CAOC has tasked us with taking it off the board for good\".\n\n\"Our Intel folks have been on a dedicated push to locate the battery early enough to enable us to strike it before it relocates, and it looks like they've finally come up with the goods\". \n\nPopeye clicked a slide onto the briefing screen at the front of the room.\n\n\"Late yesterday we located the SA-10 battery beginning to deploy alongside the SAA 121st Brigade at Kanaker, some 15 miles southwest of Damascus\".\n\n\"As you can see this position is well defended, with two SA-15s providing SHORAD to the site, in addition the SA-10 itself.  The position is also likely to be well protected by other Syrian SAMs in the area.  This one will be a tough nut to crack\".\n\n\"The battery itself appears to contain a Tin Shield search radar in place of the usual Big Bird, but apart from that consists of all the usual elements we expect to see.  Your mission is the destruction of the entire battery\".\n\nPopeye continued,  \"Our detachment will be split into two groups.  I will lead Sword 1, consisting of Tank, Ghost and Shade in a diversion attack on Damascus, along with a package of Strike Eagles and two B-1s.  This attack will be carried out from the north, flowing down the Homs road towards the Damascus area\".\n\n\"While this is happening, Sword 2, led by Forrest, will be attacking from the south.  The attack will follow an unconventional route, entering Syria from northwest Jordan and overflying Israeli airspace as you do so.  The Israelis it seems are keen to have this SA-10 battery taken out\".\n\n\"Oh now they stand down!\" Rotor exclaimed over-dramatically, to a few stunted laughs from the rest of the detachment.\n\n\"Guess they're leaving the job to the specialists,\" Popeye replied.  \"Anyway, you will enter Israeli airspace south of Haifa, mimicking an approach towards Ramat David.  The IAF have agreed to keep the airspace clear as you approach the area, which will allow you to descend to low altitude and make a low level ingress towards Syria, hopefully unseen by the SA-10.  You will then proceed over the Jordanian border, turning northeast before Irbid and continuing at low level into Syria.  Once you arrive at the target you will execute a four ship, low level pop up attack on the SA-10 battery, destroying all battery elements before egressing the area back through Israel\".\n\n\"Sounds easy!\" said Rotor sarcastically, \"No wonder the IAF left this one to us\".\n\n\"What support will we have sir?\" I asked, cutting Rotor off.\n\nPopeye responded, \"Sword 2 will be supported by the Marine detachment of Hornets and a flight of Vipers from the 179th out of Incirlik.  Both will act as HARM shooters for you and will saturate the target, aiming to knock out the SA-15s ahead of your arrival\".\n\n\"And if they fail to do so?\" I asked.\n\nPopeye responded, \"You will also have Spartan 3 to escort you into the target area, and they will set up in a standoff jam while you run in on the target.  That combined with the element of surprise should give you enough time to get in, destroy the target and get out again before the Syrians can respond\". \n\nHaving briefed the mission overview, we then broke down the mission into more detail.\n\nDeparting Akrotiri as a four ship, I will lead Sword 2 south across the sea from Akrotiri to waypoint 4, joining up with the Marine Hornets, callsign Buzzard 1, as we proceed south.  Rotor will be my wingman as Sword 2-2, with Bug leading Boomer in the second element as Sword 2-3 and Sword 2-4.\n\nAt waypoint 4 we will rendezvous with our Growler escort, Spartan 3 and proceed southeast for waypoint 5.  We will collect another addition to our strike package at waypoint 5, the Vipers out of Incirlik, callsign Bulldog 6.\n\nOnce the package is fully assembled, we will switch to our strike frequency and begin a descent into Israel towards waypoint 6.  It's important we follow our assigned flight plan in Israel, this has been coordinated with the Israelis to ensure our airspace is clear.  Once at waypoint 6 we will then descend to 250 feet AGL and push for waypoint 7, maintaining 250 feet AGL as we do so.  Our push time is 14:02 zulu, it is important we push on time to ensure our attack will coincide with the distraction attack north of Damascus, which has a vul time of 12 minutes, until 14:14Z.  We will turn northeast at waypoint 7, ensuring we do not overfly the city of Irbid as we do so.  Popeye was quite clear on this - the Jords will not be happy if we buzz a city at high speed and low altitude.  Pushing from waypoint 7 will continue at low level on to our IP at waypoint 9.  \n\nAs we enter Syria, Buzzard and Bulldog will launch a volley of HARMs at the SA-15s at the target site - hopefully both will be fixated on threats to the north -  before turning back for home.\n\nOur IP is the town of Aqrabac, 10 miles southwest of the target.  As we pass the IP we should note an obstacle - the hill to the town's northwest, which has an elevation of 3,000 feet MSL, approximately 300 feet higher than the town.\n\nWe have been reassured that the earthworks on the hill are a long standing, unoccupied defensive position.  Let's hope that's still the case.\n\nAs we make our low level ingress into Syria we should ensure we remain at 250 feet AGL to keep ourselves masked against the Syrian SAMs until we execute our attack.  This will be a very high threat environment and we do not want to reveal our presence early.\n\nPushing from the IP, we will execute our attack at 5.5 nm from the target.  This will be a four ship pop up attack using CBU-87, each member of the flight will execute a separate attack profile to ensure deconfliction from one another, and to get all aircraft through the target in under 60 seconds.  Our attack heading has been designed to keep our attack axis away from Kanaker itself and minimize the potential for collateral damage.\n\nAt 5.5nm from the target I will break 20 degrees left, roll out and then pull into a 20 degree climb.  As I reach 3,500 feet AGL I will then pull back down onto the target and maintain a 5 degree track nose low, aiming to release 2 CBUs at approximately 2,700 feet AGL.  My target will be the Tin Shield search radar and command post (C2), located at waypoint 10.\n\nRotor will be targeting the Flap Lid and TEL site Bravo, Bug TEL site Alpha and Boomer the Clam Shell.\n\nOnce all attacks are complete we will then rally back in Jordan at waypoint 12, before pushing back home, departing Israel via waypoint 5.  As we push back west into Israel from waypoint 12 we must observe a pre-agreed altitude of 14,000 feet MSL, to help Israeli air defense operators identify us.  We have also been warned by the Israelis that we must keep clear of the Golan heights, located west of waypoint 9.  IDF forces in this area are on high alert and approaching this position risks us being engaged by Israeli air defenses.\n\nWe will each be carrying two CBU-87s for the attack, along with the standard fit of ECM, target and HTS pods and 2 fuel tanks.  Bingo fuel for the mission is 3,100 lb.\n\nBullseye for this mission will be located on Damascus International Airport.\n\nWe concluded the briefing with a threat analysis.  There can be no mistakes here, we are flying into a web of complex air defenses, consisting of SA-15s, SA-10, S-60 and ZU-23 at the target site.  In addition to this we can expect a mix of SA-2, SA-3, SA-6, SA-8 and SA-11 in the Damascus area.  Many of these sites are mobile and we can't be certain of their exact positions, however we know for sure that there is an SA-2 and SA-3 at Mezzeh airbase, an SA-6 at Marj Ruhayill and an SA-3 at DIAP.\n\nWe expect Kanaker to be within range of a number of threats, however a combination of our deception attack to the north, jamming and surprise should work to keep us safe - providing we follow the plan and don't make any mistakes at least.  Re-attacks on the target are not advised, and we should also remain aware of our position in relation to known threats at all times - get out of position and we risk rendering Spartan's jamming ineffective.  We should also note the position of Tha'lah airbase, east of our egress route, which has been noted in the past to contain an SA-6.  Although the chance of Syrian fighter interference remains low, we are starting to see more activity by the SyAAF.  Mig-21, Mig-23 and Mig-29 are all potential threats we should be alert to.\n\nThe briefing then ended and the four of us tasked with this mission retreated to study the mission in it's every detail.  There's a lot to remember; restricted airspace, time on target, attack profiles, threat positions and egress altitudes.  We're going to earn our pay on this one.  Takeoff is 13:40 zulu.\n\n\n" : "\"好的飞行员们，咱们开始吧。正如你们中几位已经亲身体会到的，叙利亚的SA-10系统这几天一直在骚扰我们。叙利亚人把他们的Grumble玩得很精明，限制雷达辐射并每隔24-36小时转移阵地。据信这个Grumble是叙利亚人最后一套战略级别防空系统，仍构成重大威胁，因此联合作战中心命令我们永久摧毁它。\"\n\n\"我们的情报人员一直在全力追踪这套系统，争取在其转移前锁定位置实施打击，现在他们终于有了成果。\"\n\nPopeye在简报室前方屏幕切换了一张幻灯片。\n\n\"昨天傍晚，我们发现SA-10阵地开始在大马士革西南15英里的卡纳克部署，与叙利亚政府军第121旅协同驻防。\"\n\n\"如你们所见，这个阵地防守严密，除SA-10本体外还有两套SA-15负责近程防空。该区域其他叙利亚防空系统可能也会提供掩护。这是块难啃的硬骨头。\"\n\n\"该阵地似乎用Tin Shield搜索雷达替代了常规的Big Bird，但其余组件都是标准配置。你们的任务是彻底摧毁整个防空阵地。\"\n\nPopeye继续道：\"我们分队将分为两组。我将率领Sword 1编队，包括Tank、Ghost和Shade，协同一个F-15E攻击机分队和两架B-1对大马士革实施佯攻。攻击将从北面沿霍姆斯公路南下，向大马士革方向推进。\"\n\n\"与此同时，由Forrest率领的Sword 2将从南面进攻。攻击路线非常规：从约旦西北部进入叙利亚，途中飞越以色列领空。以色列人似乎很希望我们解决掉这个SA-10阵地。\"\n\n\"哦，现在他们倒袖手旁观了！\"Rotor夸张地喊道，引来分队其他成员几声克制的笑声。\n\n\"看来他们要把专业的事交给专业的人。\"Popeye回应道，\"你们将在海法以南进入以色列空域，模拟向拉马特戴维基地的进近路线。以军已同意在你们接近时清空空域，使你们能下降至低空隐蔽进入叙利亚，希望不会被SA-10发现。随后你们将越过约旦边境，在伊尔比德之前转向东北，保持低空突入叙利亚。抵达目标后以四机编队实施低空跃升攻击，彻底摧毁SA-10阵地所有单元，最后经以色列撤离。\"\n\n\"听起来真轻松！\"Rotor讽刺地说，\"难怪以军把这活儿让给我们。\"\n\n\"长官，我们有哪些支援？\"我打断Rotor问道。\n\nPopeye回答：\"Sword 2将得到海军陆战队的'Hornet'中队和Incirlik基地179中队的'Viper'支援。他们将作为HARM导弹发射单元实施饱和攻击，争取在你们抵达前消灭SA-15。\"\n\n\"如果失败了呢？\"\n\nPopeye答道：\"Spartan 3会护送你们进入目标区，在你们突袭时实施防区外电子干扰。配合突袭的突然性，应该能在叙利亚人反应前完成攻击撤离。\"\n\n任务概述简报结束后，我们开始细化行动方案。\n\n四机编队从Akrotiri起飞后，我将率领Sword 2向南飞越海面至航路点4，与呼号Buzzard 1的海军陆战队Hornet分队汇合。Rotor作为我的僚机Sword 2-2，Bug带领Boomer组成第二小队Sword 2-3和Sword 2-4。\n\n在航路点4与我们的Growler护航机Spartan 3汇合后，向东南飞往航路点5。届时将加入来自Incirlik基地、呼号Bulldog 6的Viper分队。\n\n编队集结完毕后，我们将切换至攻击频率，开始向以色列境内的航路点6下降。必须严格遵守在以色列的飞行计划，这是与以军协调确保空域清空的关键。到达航路点6后下降至250英尺AGL，向航路点7推进。突击时间为14:02Z，准时行动才能确保与北面佯攻同步——佯攻窗口期为12分钟至14:14Z。在航路点7转向东北时注意避开伊尔比德城区——Popeye特别强调：约旦人对我们高速低空掠过城市可不会高兴。从航路点7继续低空飞行至航路点9的初始点(IP)。\n\n进入叙利亚时，Buzzard和Bulldog将向目标区的SA-15齐射HARM导弹——希望它们都专注于北面威胁——然后返航。\n\n我们的IP是目标西南10英里的Aqrabac镇。经过IP时要注意西北方向海拔3000英尺MSL的山丘，比镇子高约300英尺。\n\n已确认山上的防御工事是长期闲置的。希望情况依旧如此。\n\n低空突入叙利亚时必须保持250英尺AGL，利用地形遮蔽叙利亚防空系统。这是极高威胁环境，绝不能提前暴露行踪。\n\n从IP开始攻击时，将在距目标5.5海里处实施四机编队CBU-87集束炸弹跃升攻击。每架飞机采用不同攻击剖面确保互不冲突，整个编队需在60秒内完成攻击。设计的攻击航向能避开卡纳克城区，最大限度减少附带损伤。\n\n在距目标5.5海里处，我将左转20度改平，然后以20度角爬升。到达3500英尺AGL时俯冲对准目标，保持5度下倾角，在约2700英尺AGL投掷2枚CBU。我的目标是位于航路点10的Tin Shield搜索雷达和指挥所(C2)。\n\nRotor负责攻击Flap Lid雷达和Bravo发射车，Bug攻击Alpha发射车，Boomer攻击Clam Shell雷达。\n\n完成攻击后，我们将在约旦的航路点12重新集结，然后经航路点5离开以色列返航。从航路点12西返时必须遵守预先约定的14000英尺MSL高度，便于以军防空识别。以军还警告必须避开航路点9以西的戈兰高地——该地区以军处于高度戒备状态，接近可能招致防空火力。\n\n每架飞机携带2枚CBU-87执行攻击，标准配置包括ECM吊舱、目标指示吊舱、HTS吊舱和2个副油箱。任务最低返航油量3100磅。\n\n本次任务的基准点设在大马士革国际机场。\n\n简报最后是威胁分析。绝不能出错——我们正飞入由SA-15、SA-10、S-60和ZU-23组成的复杂防空网。大马士革周边还有SA-2、SA-3、SA-6、SA-8和SA-11的混合部署。其中多数是机动部署，无法精确定位，但确认Mezzeh空军基地有SA-2和SA-3，Marj Ruhayill有SA-6，DIAP有SA-3。\n\n卡纳克处于多个威胁系统的射程内，但北面佯攻、电子干扰和突袭的协同效应应该能保障安全——前提是我们严格执行计划。不建议二次攻击，同时必须时刻注意与已知威胁的相对位置——偏离位置可能导致Spartan的电子干扰失效。还需注意撤离路线东侧的Tha'lah空军基地，该处曾部署SA-6。虽然遭遇叙利亚战机拦截概率较低，但叙利亚空军的活动正日趋频繁，需警惕Mig-21、Mig-23和Mig-29的潜在威胁。\n\n简报结束后，我们四名任务执行者开始研究每个细节。要记住的内容很多：禁飞区、攻击时间、攻击剖面、威胁位置和撤离高度。这次任务得拿出真本事了。起飞时间13:40Z。",
