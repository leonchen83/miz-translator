  "Cmdr Patrick, as the most senior officer present, stood up and walked over to the whiteboard in the middle of the room. Saint in a flight suit was not a common sight, as - except times when he was scheduled to fly, like now - he preferred to parade in his khaki uniform.\n\n\"We are on our way to Iraq and in the next few days, we will start flying combat sorties to support our boys on the ground. The hop today is part of a workup that will allow us to be on the step when that happens. That is why I expect you to stay focused on the task at hand and closely follow your flight plan. You heard lieutenant junior grade, people. Iranians are closely looking at each and every one of our steps and the last thing we need is to have any incidents. Steer clear from Waterloo Red and always know exactly where you are. Situational awareness. If you spot anything suspicious, report back to Mother and wait for orders. Questions?\"\n\nSilence. \n\n\"Good. Conduct your briefs.\"\n\n5 minutes later\nReady Room 7\n\n\"So, Mr. Wilson, today I'll have a rare honor to dogfight a Top Gun graduate. Cannot wait to see what you can teach me\".\n\n\"Yes, Sir\" - Flip did his best to ignore deep notes of sarcasm in his XO's voice.\n\n\"But first things first. I'll take 402, you'll go in 403, both jets are parked in the Street. We should be ready for a launch by 0800. Join up off the bow in parade formation, after which we'll climb to angels 15 and continue towards waypoint 2, where we should conduct our training.\n\nOur mission today is 1 on 1 training, we'll plan several engagements. Once we enter the training area, we'll separate by half mile, lead on the right, wingman on the left. Then you will take a cutaway west, and I will go east. On my mark, we'll turn back, make a pass, and after that fight's on. After the first round, you'll go south, I'll go north, then we'll repeat on my mark\".\n\nAs he spoke, Saint was drawing a simple sketch with arrows on the whiteboard.\n\n\"Sir.. going north will get you closer to Iranian airspace. Shouldn't we rather keep east-west separation?\"\n\n\"Negative, Flip. We will be far enough from Iran so it won't matter.. Now, weapons. We'll have two practice CATM-9Ms each, so we'll be working with them and the guns. Of course, no ammo is loaded, we will enter SIM mode once 'fight' command is given. We will verify all 'hit' calls at the debrief. We'll keep fighting until one of us is on ladder, then we'll go back to the boat\".\n\n\"As for the radios - we will stay on Ch1 on AUX at all times, with Strike on PRI. Weather is not an issue, calm winds, and scattered clouds at 10 000. Questions?\"\n\n\"Sir, what speed en route?\"\n\n\"We'll keep Mach 0.70.\"\n\n\"Roger. What will be our hard deck?\"\n\n\"What is this Mr. Wilson, Jeopardy? Set it to 5 000 feet. Any more questions?\" - Saint put extra emphasis on 'more'.\n\n\"No, Sir.\"\n\n\"Good. Oh, one more thing. Personally, I think we may end up fighting Iran rather than staying over Iraq. It is crucial that we keep our heads cool and don't do anything that can be seen as provocative. Got it?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir.\"\n\nSaint stood there for a moment longer, looking at Wilson. Finally, he nodded and started walking towards the door. Flip followed him, and as he was passing duty officer's desk, NTTTY said \"Have a good flight, OPSO\", followed by a much, much quieter \"If it is at all possible...\" Wilson pretended he did not hear that.\n\n---------- DESIGNER'S NOTES ----------\n\nUpdated version of the campaign uses new system that can replace using SPACE BAR and F-10 menu almost completely. Instructions how to set it up will appear as soon as you jump into the pit.\n\nSaint will start moving around 30 seconds after you indicate you are ready to taxi. Start moving soon after him to the catapult shown by the director. Try to time the launch, so that you launch shortly after him.\n\nWhile practicing with Saint whenever you shoot a simulated AIM-9, press Space Bar for Fox 2 call. Use guns normally (with Master Arm ON!) only after you shoot both your missiles.   \n\nSaint can hit you with guns too. Due to DCS limitations he WILL NOT use / call out AIM-9 shots. \n\nDo not use BACKSPACE key to hide the stick during startup or map it to something else, using BACKSPACE has been reported to break the mission and cause Saint not to attack you in the training phase.\n\nMake sure to keep the fight above 10 000 feet. AI has tendency to dive into the see if you get too low. \n\nEstimated mission time: 60 minutes. " : " \n帕特里克司令作为在场最高军衔军官站起身，走向会议室中央的白板。这位身着飞行服的\"SAINT\"并不常见——除非像现在这样排到飞行班次时——他平时更偏爱穿卡其色制服示人。\n\n\"我们正在前往伊拉克途中，未来几天将开始执行战斗任务支援地面部队。今天的飞行是战前训练的一部分，确保我们能随时投入实战。因此我要求你们务必专注当前任务，严格遵循飞行计划。各位都听到少尉的汇报了，伊朗人正紧盯着我们的一举一动，绝不能发生任何意外。避开Waterloo红线区域，随时掌握自身位置。保持态势感知！发现任何可疑情况立即向母舰汇报并等待指示。有问题吗？\"\n\n全场寂静。\n\n\"很好，开始简报。\"\n\n五分钟后\n7号待命室\n\n\"威尔逊先生，今天我很荣幸能与TOP GUN毕业生进行空战训练。迫不及待想领教你的本事。\"\n\n\"是，长官。\"FLIP竭力忽略副指挥官话中浓重的讥讽。\n\n\"先确认基本事项：我驾驶402号机，你驾驶403号机，两架都在甲板待命。0800前完成起飞准备，在舰首以阅兵队形集结，爬升至15,000英尺后前往2号航路点展开训练。\"\n\n\"今日任务是一对一空战训练，规划多轮对抗。进入训练空域后间隔半英里分离，长机居右，僚机居左。你向西脱离，我向东脱离。听我指令同时转向接敌，首轮交锋后你向南脱离，我向北脱离，重复对抗流程。\"\n\nSAINT边说边在白板上用箭头绘制简易示意图。\n\n\"长官...向北脱离会接近伊朗领空。是否保持东西向分离更稳妥？\"\n\n\"不必，FLIP。我们与伊朗保持足够安全距离。武器配置：每机挂载两枚CATM-9M训练弹，配合机炮使用。弹药未装填，接到'交战'指令后切换至模拟模式。所有命中判定将在任务复盘时核实。对抗持续至一方被锁定，随即返航。\"\n\n\"无线电设定：全程使用备用1频道，主频道保持与STRIKE编队联络。天气状况良好，风速平缓，10,000英尺高度有碎云。有问题？\"\n\n\"长官，转场速度？\"\n\n\"保持马赫数0.7。\"\n\n\"明白。训练最低高度？\"\n\n\"威尔逊先生，你当这是智力竞猜吗？设为5,000英尺。还有问题？\"SAINT特别加重了\"还有\"二字。\n\n\"没有，长官。\"\n\n\"很好。补充一点：我个人认为我们最终可能与伊朗交战而非停留伊拉克上空。关键是要保持冷静，避免任何挑衅行为。明白？\"\n\n\"明白，长官。\"\n\nSAINT凝视威尔逊片刻后点头走向门口。FLIP经过值勤军官桌旁时，NTTTY说道：\"祝飞行顺利，作战官\"，又用几乎微不可闻的声音补充：\"如果真有可能的话...\"威尔逊假装没有听见。\n\n---------- 设计师说明 ----------\n\n战役更新版采用新系统，基本可完全替代空格键和F-10菜单功能。进入座舱后将立即显示设置指引。\n\nSAINT会在你准备滑行后30秒开始移动。跟随地勤指引前往弹射器，尽量与他同步起飞。\n\n与SAINT训练时：发射模拟AIM-9需按空格键进行\"Fox2\"呼叫。仅在两枚导弹发射后（主武器开关开启状态下）使用机炮。\n\n注意：SAINT也会用机炮攻击你。受DCS限制，他不会发射/呼叫AIM-9导弹。\n\n切勿在启动时使用退格键隐藏操纵杆，或将该键位重映射。据报告使用退格键会导致任务异常，使SAINT在训练阶段不发动攻击。\n\n保持空战高度在10,000英尺以上。若高度过低，AI可能会俯冲入海。\n\n预计任务时长：60分钟。",

  "Sunday, 10/02/2008, 06:30 Valley Forge, Gulf of Oman (2418N 05858E)\n\nThe screen of the CCTV in Ready Room 7 Flickered as LT JG Josh Fagan, callsign NTTTY (Not Time To Talk Yet), the duty officer for that morning, switched it from rows of letters and numbers displayed on ship's SINS page to a pleasant face of a female officer from CVIC. \n\n\"Good morning, Air Wing Four, and welcome to the current intelligence brief, followed by event one briefing. I'm Lieutenant JG Helen McHardy.  CSG-4 is currently transiting the Gulf of Oman on her way to the Persian Gulf, where she will be supporting Phantom Phoenix - part of Operation Iraqi Freedom\".\n\nFlip looked around. There were 6 pilots scheduled for Event 1 this day. He would fly as Raven 22 with Cmdr Bill 'Saint' Patrick, Ravens' XO, on 1 vs 1 guns only training. Lt Sam 'Blade' Cutter and Lt Kristin 'Olive' Teel were going on an SSSC mission alongside the route of CSG-4 towards the Strait of Hormuz. Finally, Lt Mike 'Dutch' Van Booven and Lt Ramer 'Prince' Howard would launch sometime later as Raven 31. All six of them were now watching the screen.\n\n\"Our task as CSG-4 is to relieve USS Enterprise in providing support - mostly CAS - to our troops in Iraq. In the next few days, we will be launching several flights a day to that end. Our forces in the area are currently limited and consist of two FFGs: USS Richard Best and USS Marion Carl. We also have some assets in Al Dhafra Air Base in UAE, Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, as well as Shaykh Isa Air Base and Khalifa Ibn Salman Port in Bahrain.\n\nLet's move to the event one brief. Weather is good with visibility greater than 10 miles, the seas are calm. Launches will commence at 0800 and recoveries are planned for 0900, CASE I for both. The CSG-4 will continue at a steady course across the GOO, so expect recovery around 20 miles northwest from the current position. Mother's TACAN is 66X, frequency 144.000.\n\nThe divert airfield is Fujairah International Airport in UAE, any permissions to land will be handled by the ship as there is no AWACS on station today. Restricted zones - airspace of all the Gulf countries, with Iran being an absolute no-go zone.\"\n\nLieutenant JG McHardy stopped for a moment to look at her notes and then continued.\n\n\"Event one lineup and objectives. The ship will launch a total of 6 Hornets and one Viking. Raven 11 will be tasked with SSSC along the route of CSG-4. Raven 21 and Raven 31 will perform 1 vs 1 as fragged. Texaco will act as standby tanker. Control will be provided by Strike. That is all from my side, have a good flight\".\n\nBefore she vanished, McHardy smiled at the camera and everyone in the room, maybe excluding Olive, thought - not for the first time - that it was a very pleasant smile." : "2008年10月2日 星期日 06:30 阿曼湾 \"福吉谷\"号航母 (北纬24度18分 东经58度58分)\n\n第七待命室的监控屏幕闪烁了一下，值班军官乔什·法甘少尉——呼号NTTTY（暂勿交谈）——将显示着舰船SINS系统字母数字页面的画面切换成了CVIC部门一位女性军官亲切的面容。\n\n\"早上好，第四航空联队。欢迎收听当前情报简报及第一飞行事件简报。我是海伦·麦克哈迪少尉。CSG-4战斗群正穿越阿曼湾向波斯湾航行，将在那里支持'幻影凤凰行动'——这是'伊拉克自由行动'的组成部分。\"\n\nFLIP环顾四周。当天有6名飞行员参加第一飞行事件。他将以Raven 22的呼号与中队执行官比尔·\"SAINT\"·帕特里克中校进行一对一机炮训练。萨姆·\"BLADE\"·卡特中尉和克里斯汀·\"OLIVE\"·蒂尔中尉将执行SSSC任务，沿CSG-4航线前往霍尔木兹海峡。迈克·\"DUTCH\"·范布文中尉与拉默·\"PRINCE\"·霍华德中尉稍后将作为Raven 31起飞。此刻六人都在注视着屏幕。\n\n\"CSG-4的任务是接替'企业号'航母，主要为伊拉克境内的友军提供近距离空中支援。未来几天我们将为此每天出动多个架次。当前战区兵力有限，仅有两艘护卫舰：'USS理查德·贝斯特号'和'马里昂·卡尔号'。我们在阿联酋的达夫拉空军基地、卡塔尔的乌代德空军基地，以及巴林的谢克伊萨空军基地与哈利法·本·萨勒曼港也有部分驻军。\"\n\n\"现在进行第一飞行事件简报。天气良好，能见度超过10海里，海况平静。0800开始起飞，0900计划回收，均按CASE I程序进行。CSG-4将保持稳定航向穿越阿曼湾，预计回收位置在当前位置西北方向约20海里处。母舰TACAN频道66X，频率144.000。\"\n\n\"备降机场为阿联酋富查伊拉国际机场，所有着陆许可由母舰协调，今日无AWACS执勤。禁飞区域——所有海湾国家领空，伊朗为绝对禁入区。\"\n\n麦克哈迪少尉停顿片刻查看笔记后继续道：\n\n\"第一飞行事件编组及任务目标。舰上将出动6架大黄蜂和1架北欧海盗。Raven 11负责沿CSG-4航线执行SSSC任务。Raven 21与Raven 31按预定方案进行1v1对抗。Texaco加油机待命支援。管制由Strike部门负责。简报完毕，祝飞行顺利。\"\n\n画面消失前，麦克哈迪对着摄像头微笑——也许除了\"OLIVE\"之外，房间里所有人（这已非首次）都觉得这个笑容令人如沐春风。",

Heroes of Might and Magic\" - Smoke grinned.\n\n\"Let's just hope here be no dragons... We'll depart on Mother's 350 for 15 angels 3 (our WP1), after the turn we will join up while climbing to angels 20 for the tanker. We'll get a drink, break towards waypoint 3. We will check in with Magic and I will anchor at waypoint 4, while you  take a cut away for your IP. Then. we'll start the main part of our today's mission\". \n\nFlip switched the picture, and now a map of this area of GOO was visible with waypoints and tanker tracks. \n\n\"You will extend to the south - east for 50-60 miles of separation. Once you get there, call \"tapes on\" and start heading my way. I'll monitor Strike and check Magic calls against the SA page and radar\".\n\n\"Roger\".\n\n\"Next I'll get on your six and we'll do one on one with you beginning in a defensive position. After I shoot both my CATM-9s, we'll swap roles. By then we should be close to recovery time and head back to boat. Any questions?\"\n\n\"Negative\".\n\n\"Not much on weapons - we have two training 'winders and no ammo for the gun. We'll go into SIM mode, you know the drill\".\n\n\"Sure\".\n\n\"Radios. We'll do checks on deck, then switch to channel 2 on Pri when we turn towards Texaco. Then channel 3 for Magic part. We'll stay on 1 on Aux.\"\n\nSmoke nodded, making some notes on his kneeboard.\n\n\"Now, weather. Very unusual for this part of the world, although not unseen in this time of the year. We have strong wind, low hanging clouds and rain, with forecasted thunderstorms. We should be back on deck before it hits, but I sure hope captain will call off the night events...\"\n\n\"Who is on the schedule for these?\" - Smoke checked the board with the names hanging on one of the walls.\n\n\"Skipper, XO, Psycho and Sponge Bob\". \n\n\"I sure am happy to be on this event then.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Any questions?\"\n\nSmoke shook his head.\n\n\"Roger. Let's go\".\n\n---------- DESIGNER'S NOTES ----------\n\n1. Smoke will start up his jet when YOU taxi towards the assigned CAT (2).  You should launch at time he joins his CAT 1 (approx. 60 seconds before he is launched).\n\n2. During training with Smoke use WEAPON RELEASE button for simulated AIM-9 shots.

It is strongly recommended that these are uninstalled. \n\n4. Mission length: around 70 minutes." : "FLIP站起身打开了投影仪。他身后的白屏上很快显示出任务基本信息幻灯片。\n\n\"好的，我们将与'Magic'配合进行空中加油和空战训练。我驾驶403号机，你飞410号，两架都停在'畜栏区'。本次任务的战术呼号是'Springfield71'和'72'，本次行动的预警机代号为'Magic'。\"\n\n\"我喜欢，像《魔法门英雄》游戏似的。\"Smoke咧嘴笑了。\n\n\"只希望别冒出条龙来...我们沿母舰350航向起飞，爬升至15高度层3号空域（即第一个航路点），转弯后爬升到20高度层与加油机会合。加完油后向3号航路点转向。与'Magic'建立联系后，我将在4号航路点盘旋，你则切入初始攻击位置。然后开始今天的主要训练内容。\"\n\nFLIP切换画面，现在显示的是该作战区域的航路点与加油机航线图。\n\n\"你需要向东南方向延伸50-60英里建立间隔。抵达后呼叫'进入任务状态'并开始向我方靠拢。我会监控STRIKE频道，同时对照态势感知页面与雷达确认'Magic'的呼叫。\"\n\n\"明白。\"\n\n\"接着我会咬住你六点钟方向，由你从防御态势开始进行一对一对抗。等我发射完两枚CATM-9训练弹后，我们交换攻防角色。届时应该接近返航时间，直接回舰。有问题吗？\"\n\n\"没有。\"\n\n\"武器配置很简单——就两枚训练用响尾蛇导弹，机炮也没配实弹。进入模拟模式，你都懂的。\"\n\n\"当然。\"\n\n\"无线电设置。甲板检查用主频道1，转向'Texaco'加油机时切主频道2。与'Magic'协同阶段用主频道3。备用频道1保持常开。\"\n\nSmoke点头，在膝板上做着记录。\n\n\"天气情况。虽不是这个季节完全没见过，但对本地来说很反常。强风、低云、降雨，预报还有雷暴。我们应该能在恶劣天气前着舰，不过真希望舰长能取消夜间活动......\"\n\n\"今晚轮值名单是谁？\"Smoke查看着墙上的值班表。\n\n\"舰长、副舰长、疯子和海绵宝宝。\"\n\n\"那我可真庆幸参加这次训练。\"\n\n\"是啊。还有问题吗？\"\n\nSmoke摇头。\n\n\"收到，出发吧。\"\n\n---------- 设计师注释 ----------\n\n1. 当您滑向2号弹射位时，Smoke会启动发动机。您应在他抵达1号弹射位（约在其弹射前60秒）时起飞。\n\n2. 与Smoke训练时使用武器发射按钮模拟AIM-9射击。训练全程Smoke将作为蓝方单位。\n\n3. 第三方非官方模组（包括Voice Attack）已知会影响本任务及DLC战役运行。强烈建议卸载这些模组。\n\n4. 任务时长：约70分钟。",

  "At that, pilots stood up and gathered around their flight leaders. Cajun was going over Raven 11's mission with Sponge Bob, for whom that would be the first flight since the barricade two days prior. Flip waited for Smoke and Dutch to approach him and then nodded to Psycho, who was on desk duty, to load up his presentation. Few seconds later, a large map of the Gulf appeared on the main screen in the briefing room.\n\n[BRIEF 1] \"OK guys, listen up. We had the general briefing at the AOM yesterday, now it's time for core business. Our task for today is to go to assigned area and perform a X-CAS in case guys on the ground require our help. They require two-ship flight. To be sure, we will launch three-ship flight, with Dutch in backup role in case that me or Smoke meet NOGO criteria. If no problems found, Dutch will stop following us and start his secondary mission of Sea Surface Search Contact (SSSC) to investigate vessels in vicinity of carrier group. Let's get to it.\n\nFirst, the assignments. I'm in 403, you Smoke in 410, Dutch will take 407. We are Nail 41 and 42 for this one, Dutch is Nail 51, provided that  all checks are good. We're going to step at 0803, check comms and crank up at 0805, then take off with 1 minute separation. Smoke, you will go first at 0810, I'll launch second, Dutch third. \n\nI'll join up on Smoke, take formation lead and we'll perform items checks. If our countermeasures are working as advertised, we will push on and let Dutch have some fun around the boat. Questions?\" - Flip glanced at both junior officers and seeing there were none, nodded and continued.\n\n\"Fine. On to the mission. Our mission number is 131. We'll go direct Padres, which is our waypoint 2 using max conserve fuel profile above Angels 30. At Padres we will rendezvous with Exxon 55, an Air Force KC-135, and we'll each fuel up and then continue to the AO. Our controlling agency will be Falcon - expect Falcon Control to be on Magenta 13 - who will assign us a specific area, altitude block and local commander, who then may pass us down directly to the troops on the ground. All the comms are listed on the card or the day and we'll be using colours and numbers that are unified among all the assets under Falcon's control. We'll stay in our assigned sector and tank as required until we're Winchester or must RTB at time 12:30. Questions?\"\n \n\"Yeah\" - Smoke pointed at the map - \"enemy activity. What can we expect?\"\n\n\"The usual. Groups of bad-guys with small-caliber weapons and probable MANPADs. They know the AO extremely well and are capable of blending with the terrain. As Skipper said the other day: we will rely on the JTAC, but we are also free to question him and make our own calls if we think we are in danger of violating the ROE.\"\n\nAs there were no further questions, Flip moved on.\n\n\"Weapons. We'll go with one GBU-38, one GBU-12, full 20 mike-mike, FLIR, wingtip 'winders and two tanks each. For the LGBs we'll set up different codes, which are listed in the kneeboards. We'll fence in before we get to Waypoint 1. Anything on weapons?\"\n\nSmoke and Dutch shook their heads in unison.\n\n\"Good. Comms. We'll perform check in on channel 1 on Pri and Aux. Once we join up I'll switch us to Strike on Pri, and then continue as directed by controlling agencies. You guys set your TACANs according to the kneeboard, I'll get us to the tanker and later on back to Mother. Questions?\"\n\nNo questions. \n\n[BRIEF 2] \"You have seen the weather. Those dust storms can get nasty and really limit the visibility. Still, according to the forecasts, it is now much worse in the southern Gulf and shouldn't be as bad near Basra. We will adapt to what we'll find.\n\n[MAPS] Next, our flight plan. As I mentioned before, at waypoint 1 we're going to fence in and climb above Angels 20, flying towards Padres. Magic will do his... well, magic, with the controlling agencies along the way so we don't have to worry about that. We will check in with Basra Center before entering Padres, where we will join up with Exxon and get a drink (top off). After that we'll talk to Falcon, go to the assigned kill box: 89 Alpha, Bravo or Charlie and descend to assigned altitude block. We will roam in the box and wait if we're called, refuel, roam some more and then depart, coming back almost exactly the same way we came. \n\nFinally, the emergencies. In case of any problems with one of our jets, Dutch will jump in and take over. As you have seen, our divert for today is Sir Abu Nuayr - if you have to go there, be careful, as the runway is pretty damn short. Any plans to use Bahraini bases went Tango Uniform with the weather. We'll set our joker to 5000 and tank to 3000, should be enough to get to tank. In case of trouble with the tanker, Falcon will guide us to divert field in Iraq or Kuwait. If one of us has to bail, friendly forces should be in the area, although the population is known to support the rebels - so better stay out of sight. \n\nAlright guys, I think that's it. Last questions or anything to add?\"\n\nFlip looked at each of the pilots in turn. \n\n\"Negative\"\n\n\"Nope\"\n\n\"Alright! Let's do it!\".\n\nDESIGNER'S NOTES:\n\n1, Smoke take off first, you Taxi to CAT3 when instructed to and launch on briefed time, then catch up Smoke and join his right wing on the way to WP 1\n\n2. this mission will require you to perform air to air refuelling at least once. However, in the first 60 seconds you will have option to skip first part and load version of the mission where you will start behind Exxon with full tanks on the way to the AO or after the mission.\n\n3. tune Exxon Tacan after directed to switch to his frequency, then set best intercept course for AAR. No need to reach Padres WP\n\n4. in AO, have the FLARE rich program ready to use on your finger when you get low\n\n5. JTAC will do talk-on with you mentioning roads, but there are NO roads in this corner of DCS map, just blured textures of what may look like roads. Be patient, look out of cockpit and follow textured roads as told to. If unable to find your target by eyeball, use ATFLIR in IR mode\n\n6. when RTB, take from Exxon only fuel needed to land on ship, otherwise you will need dump some fuel due to overweight\n\n7. Estimated mission length: 150 minutes" : "听到这里，飞行员们起身围拢到各自的编队领队身边。卡真正在向海绵宝宝讲解Raven 11的任务——这将是后者自两天前阻拦索事故后的首次飞行。FLIP等斯莫克和达奇走近后，向担任值勤官的精神病点头示意，后者随即调出了任务简报。几秒钟后，简报室主屏幕上显示出波斯湾的大幅地图。\n\n[简报1] \"好，都听清楚。昨天联合作战中心已经做过总体任务简报，现在进入核心环节。今天我们的任务是前往指定区域执行X-CAS（应急近距离空中支援），随时准备响应地面部队召唤。他们要求双机编队，但为确保万无一失，我们将以三机编队出击——如果我和斯莫克出现NOGO状况，达奇将作为备份接替。若一切正常，达奇将脱离编队执行次要任务：对航母战斗群周边船只进行海面搜索侦察（SSSC）。现在开始任务分解。\n\n首先是任务分配。我驾驶403号机，斯莫克410号机，达奇407号机。本次行动呼号为Nail41/42，达奇是Nail51——前提是所有检查都合格。0803时进入待命位置，0805时检查通讯并启动引擎，随后以1分钟间隔依次起飞。斯莫克你0810时第一个弹射，我第二，达奇第三。\n\n我会与斯莫克汇合后接管编队指挥权，完成系统检查。如果对抗措施正常运作，我们就继续推进，让达奇留在航母附近执行自由行动。有问题吗？\"FLIP扫视两名初级军官，见无人提问便继续。\n\n\"好，进入任务详情。本次任务编号131。我们将以最大节油模式直飞航路点2Padres（保持30000英尺以上高度）。在Padres与空军KC-135加油机（呼号Exxon55）汇合进行空中加油，随后继续飞往任务区。本次行动由Falcon控制站指挥——频率详见当日通信卡Magenta13——他们会分配具体作战区域、高度层和地面指挥官，后者可能直接将我们引导至前线部队。所有通信频道使用Falcon体系下的统一色码编号系统。我们将在指定空域待命，根据需要加油，直至弹药耗尽或1230时强制返航。有问题？\"\n\n\"有\"斯莫克指着地图问，\"敌方动态？预计会遭遇什么？\"\n\n\"常规配置。携带轻武器的小股敌军，可能配有单兵防空导弹。他们对战区地形了如指掌，擅长利用地貌隐蔽。就像中队长前几天说的：虽然要依靠JTAC引导，但如果我们认为可能违反交战规则，完全有权提出质疑并自主判断。\"\n\n见无人继续提问，FLIP推进流程。\n\n\"武器配置。每机携带GBU-38、GBU-12各一枚，20毫米机炮满装，FLIR吊舱，翼尖响尾蛇导弹和两个副油箱。激光制导炸弹使用膝板上的独立编码。航路点1之前完成战斗准备。武器方面有问题？\"\n\n斯莫克和达奇同时摇头。\n\n\"很好。通信方面。先在主备频道1完成通联检查。编队完成后我将主频道切换至Strike频率，后续按控制站指示调整。TACAN设置参照膝板参数，我会引导大家完成加油和返航。有问题？\"\n\n没有提问。\n\n[简报2] \"天气情况你们都看到了。沙尘暴可能严重影响能见度。不过根据预报，波斯湾南部更严重，BASRA附近应该相对好点。我们随机应变。\n\n[地图] 接下来是飞行计划。如前所述，航路点1完成战斗准备后爬升至20000英尺，飞往Padres。MAGIC会...施展他的魔术协调沿途管制单位，我们不必操心。进入Padres前与BASRA中心确认，与Exxon汇合补油。之后联系Falcon，前往分配的猎杀区（89A/B/C），下降至指定高度层。在区域内巡逻待命，根据需要加油，直至召唤或撤离——返航路线与进场基本相同。\n\n最后是应急预案。若任何飞机出现故障，达奇立即接替。今日备降场是Sir Abu Nuayr——注意那条跑道短得离谱。由于天气原因，巴林基地已不可用（Tango Uniform状态）。设置警戒油量5000磅，最低加油线3000磅，应该足够撑到加油点。若加油机故障，Falcon将引导至伊拉克或科威特备降场。万一有人跳伞，虽然该地区民众支持叛军，但友军应该能及时搜救——当然最好别被发现。\n\n好了兄弟们，就这些。最后的问题或补充？\"\n\nFLIP环视每位飞行员。\n\n\"没有\"\n\n\"完毕\"\n\n\"好！让我们大干一场！\"\n\n设计师备注：\n\n1. 斯莫克率先起飞，接令后滑向3号弹射器按时升空，随后在飞往WP1途中与斯莫克右翼汇合\n\n2. 本任务至少需完成一次空中加油。但开场60秒内可选择跳过前半段，载入已处在Exxon后方、满油状态前往任务区或任务后状态的版本\n\n3. 接到切换频率指令后立即调谐Exxon的TACAN，设置最佳拦截航向进行加油。无需飞抵Padres航路点\n\n4. 在任务区低空飞行时保持FLARE干扰程序随时待发\n\n5. JTAC会用道路特征引导，但DCS地图该区域没有真实道路，只有模糊纹理。保持耐心，目视跟随纹理状道路。若无法肉眼识别目标，使用ATFLIR红外模式\n\n6. 返航时仅补充着舰所需油量，否则需进行超重放油\n\n7. 预计任务时长：150分钟",

  "[It is advised to read Chapter 21 and first part of Chapter 22 from the \"Raven One\" novel] \n\nCCTV screen flickered and switched to a  face of one of CVIC female officers.\n\n\"Welcome to the event two brief, I'm lieutenant jay gee Helen McHardy. Classification level of the briefing which follows is \"restricted\" and it pertains to event number 2 on 14 February. CSG-4 is currently in the Persian Gulf, supporting operation Phantom Phoenix\".\n\nOn the screen, lieutenant's face was replaced with familiar rows of digits and numbers. \n\n[CCTV 1] \"We have good weather with a few clouds at 14 thousand feet, temperature on deck is 28 degrees Celsius with moderate wind from north - west. We do not expect any significant changes in the coming hours. However, over land you can expect heavy dust storms, limiting visibility below 5000 feet to 2-3 miles.\n\n[CCTV 2] For this event we will be launching 2 Raven Hornets on CAP, another 2 Ravens plus one airborne spare for CAS over Iraq and one tanker. Also we'll have one Switchblade in plane guard and an E-2, callsign Knight.  During the mission, the Nails will be working with USAF E-3, callsign Magic. \n\nYou can expect a Case One launch at 0800 and a Case One recovery at 0910 except for you double-cycle Ravens at 1020. The ship is MODLOC'ed at launch and recovery posit is 26 34 North and 51 50 East. Expected BRC 130.\n\nClosest land is Bahrain to the south, but  all Bahraini airports are currently out of operation due to dust storm - which means no available divert airport\".\n\nPresently, rows of letters gave way to a map showing the Persian Gulf with some of the areas - notably near Iranians shore - marked with distinctive red line.\n\n\"Restricted airspace: over Iran and the 12-mile territorial limit from any country but Kuwait. As usual, Magic will work with relevant authorities in Kuwait, Bahrain and in other places to work out the transit permissions where necessary\". \n\nThe image changed, once again turning into rows of call signs, aircraft numbers, frequencies and load outs - the Air Tasking Order.\n\n\"We already have Nail 21 in the AO over Iraq. Due to increased activity of Iranian air forces, we will be sending a CAP flight - that will be Raven 11.  Nails are tasked with X-CAS in designated area over southern Iraq. If the Nails check good, the Raven spare can perform SSSC under Strike (or Knight) control in the vicinity of the ship. Texaco will remain airborne and can be called as needed. \n\nThe card of the day contains details regarding comms, frequencies, channels and the like. \n\nFinally, the Rules of Engagement. Follow the Consolidated ROE annexed to OPORD 04/08. Some critical points:\n\nDo not enter airspace of any country without specific agreement. Steer clear from \"Waterloo Red\" - airspace and territorial waters of any country except Kuwait.\nDuring Troops In Contact situations use of kinetic strike even in urban areas is authorised, however on-scene Commander is responsible for minimizing collateral damage and responding in a proportional manner. Extra precautions should be taken during attacks on targets in close proximity of mosques and religious or historical sites. High explosive ordnance should not be employed unless absolutely necessary if such building is less than 750 meters from the target. \n\nThat is all from my side. Have a safe flight and we'll see you back on deck for a debrief.

  "Ready Room 7,\n5 minutes later\n\n\"We're in our jets today, I'm in 403, you've got 404. We'll fly as Raven 21 and 22. We're taking off behind Blade and Psycho, and let's join on the 040 at 20, angels 5. Now, as to the mission...\" (Briefing Screen 4)\n\nBoth pilots bent over the map showing the coastline of UAE and nearby islands. Flip grabbed a blue marker and started drawing as he spoke. \n\n\"We'll get on station north from Zaqqum Oilfield and check in with Strike. We will get our vectors and go separately for this one.\" - Wilson put two arrows on the map - \"and we should be working between the oilfield up to Iranian islands, more or less in this area\" - he marked it with a circle over the arrows he made earlier.\" \n\nHe then grabbed another pen, and put two more red outlines on the map.\n\n\"These are our no - go zones. Iranians have some short range SAM systems there, likely SA-15s, Rapiers and MANPADS\".   \n\n\"During our primary mission, standard procedures:  report back the type, heading and speed of all maritime traffic you are flying over. Use your radar, ATFIR and Mk1 eyeball to find any ships in the assigned area, then rig them. I'll be at 500 feet. Iranians have increased their activity in the region, and their fast movers are stopping tankers and other ships in international waters. We will work with Strike and Wizard. We're fragged to stay airborne for about 1 hour, after that we will recover back here. I'll meet you overhead at angels 3 and we'll come into the break standard.\"\n\nWeapons - we have standard loadout that will allow us to deal with almost any contingency, not that we expect one. It is likely we will be bringing it back, so watch your fuel on the way back not to exceed maximum landing weight. We're carrying a CBU-99  on station 2, AGM-65F on station 8, plus two Sidewinders, ATFLIR and two tanks. Our guns are loaded and armed. We will be heavy, but make sure to stay at max trap fuel for landing. \n\nRadios. We'll work on Strike frequency on Pri, transmitting heading and speed of all skunks we fly over. We'll remain on Flight on Aux. Switch to Strike on Pri after initial checks.\"\n\nWeather. We have a solid, 18 knot wind from the north and scattered clouds at 9 000. Same weather was reported in Al Dhafra.\n\nNot much to say on navigation, as we'll be freelancing after waypoint 2 and we should be operating quite close to Mother. Waypoints 3 and 4 are set around 15 nM off the shore of Iranian islands, so it should help us avoid them. Waypoint 6 is Rock.\n\nFinally, emergencies. We've covered the divert field already. Set joker to 5000 and give me a call if you are on your fuel ladder. Expect Texaco on station, but most likely we won't need a drink with this short cycle. Questions?\"\n\nWeed shook his head.\n\n\"No questions, Kimo sabe. Let's do it\". \n\n---------- DESIGNER'S NOTES ----------\n\nWeed will start taxiing to the CAT soon after you perform radio check. Better do that when you are ready to taxi as well. \n\nIn this mission you are require to \"rig\"  (fly over) any surface contacts you spot in the assigned area. When you do, your report for Wizard will play automatically, provided you are on correct channel. You should be around 500 feet AGL. \n\nMake sure you are in the sector assigned by Strike - if you leave it, overflying spotted vessels won't have any effect. \n\nEstimated mission length: 90 minutes" : "准备室 7，\n5分钟后\n\n\"今天我们驾驶战机，我飞403号机，你飞404号。我们以Raven 21和22呼号飞行。跟在Blade和Psycho后面起飞，加入040径向线20海里处，高度5000英尺。现在说明任务...\"（简报屏幕4）\n\n两名飞行员俯身查看显示阿联酋海岸线及附近岛屿的地图。Flip拿起蓝色记号笔边画边讲解。\n\n\"我们将抵达Zaqqum油田以北的巡逻区，向Strike报到。这次我们会分头行动。\"Wilson在地图上画出两个箭头——\"活动范围大致在油田至伊朗诸岛之间的这片区域\"他用圆圈标出了箭头覆盖的范围。\n\n他又换了支红笔，在地图上标出两个红色区域。\n\n\"这些是禁飞区。伊朗人在那里部署了短程防空系统，可能是SA-15、Rapier和单兵防空导弹。\"\n\n\"执行主要任务时按标准程序：报告你飞越海域所有船只的类型、航向和航速。使用雷达、ATFIR和目视搜索责任区内船只，然后进行标记。我将保持500英尺高度。伊朗人最近在该区域活动频繁，他们的快艇在国际水域拦截油轮和其他船只。我们将与Strike和Wizard配合行动。计划留空约1小时，之后返回基地。我将在3000英尺高度与你会合，按标准程序加入降落航线。\"\n\n\"武器挂载采用标准配置，足以应对多数突发情况——虽然不太可能用上。很可能要带弹返航，所以返航时注意油量不要超过最大着陆重量。2号挂架携带CBU-99，8号挂架AGM-65F，外加两枚响尾蛇导弹、ATFLIR吊舱和两个副油箱。机炮装填完毕。虽然载重较大，但务必确保降落时剩余油量不超过拦阻着舰限制。\"\n\n\"无线电通讯。主频与Strike保持联络，报告所有发现目标的航向航速。备用频保持编队通讯。初始检查后立即将主频切换至Strike频道。\"\n\n\"天气情况。稳定的北风18节，9000英尺高度有碎云。Al Dhafra报告相同天气。\"\n\n\"导航方面没什么特别说明，过2号航点后自由行动，活动区域距离母舰很近。3号和4号航点设在距伊朗诸岛海岸约15海里处，可帮我们避开危险。6号航点是Rock岛。\"\n\n\"最后是应急程序。备降场之前已经介绍过。将紧急油量设为5000磅，如果达到备用油量阶梯记得通知我。预计Texaco加油机会在待命区，不过这么短的飞行周期应该用不上。有问题吗？\"\n\nWeed摇了摇头。\n\n\"没问题，老伙计。开始行动吧。\"\n\n---------- 设计者说明 ----------\n\n在你完成无线电检查后，Weed很快就会滑向弹射位。建议你也做好滑行准备。\n\n本任务要求你对责任区内发现的所有水面目标进行\"标记\"（飞越）。当你在正确频道且高度保持在500英尺AGL左右时，向Wizard的报告会自动播放。\n\n确保停留在Strike分配的区域内——若离开该区域，飞越发现的船只将不会触发任务进度。\n\n预计任务时长：90分钟",

  "At this Prince stood up to conduct the brief. Today's sortie was part of his Flight Leader instruction, which meant that he was the one in charge of the whole sortie. His main goal was to show that he was capable of proficiently conducting all parts of the mission: starting from briefing, through flying it to recovery and debrief. He cleared his throat and began. \n\n\"OK, so we have been assigned aircraft numbers 402 and 412, parked on Elevator 4. We won't use a tactical call sign today - so we'll go as Raven 402 and Raven 412. We'll rendezvous at mother's 300 for 20, then climb to Angels 18 and turn southwest and make our way towards the training area.\"\n\nHe stopped, seeing a questioning look from Flip, who asked: \"Southwest?\"\n\nPrince hesitated, then looked at the CCTV screen. The ship had moved south overnight and was in a different spot than yesterday when he was preparing for the brief. \n\n\"We'll turn north and then move northwest at waypoint 2\" - he corrected himself - \"Our primary mission today will be a 1 v 1 air combat maneuvering training. We will do a series of engagements using CATM-9s and simulated gunfights until one of us reaches JOKER. Standard drill: cutaway, then left/left or right/right pass, after which the fight is on. Our operating area will be in the middle of the Gulf, around 50 miles between Iran and KSA\".\n\nHe paused to check his notes, then continued:\n\n\"Weapons - two CATM-9s each, no ammo loaded in the gun. Also, no chaff or flares. Comms - we'll switch to Strike and stay on Flight. We will also monitor Guard on both. Weather is good, no wind and no clouds in our AO, but expected sandstorm to the south and heavy clouds to the north of our current posit. Contrails starting around 28 000\".\n\nPrince stopped again, flicked a page.\n\n\"Now, flight planning. After join-up we will climb out at Mach 0.65 up to 18 000, then at WP 2 turn northwest and continue towards the AO. Stay on my left wing before the fight. After the fight, we'll climb to Angels 28 to conserve fuel, maybe do a little sightseeing and then head back to Mother. Fuel - let's set our Joker at 6 000. Texaco will be on station during our recovery\".  \n\nHe glanced at his notes one more time, before looking at Flip:\n\n\"That's all from me. Any questions?\"\n\n\"Yes. For the training part: what is the Hard Deck?\"\n\n\"The Hard Deck is set to 5000\". \n\n\"During the fight, after each hit - do we go back to where we started?\"\n\n\"Negative, we fight until we score 3 hits either with Sidewinder or the gun\". \n\n\"Roger. Let's do it\". \n\nTuesday, 17/02/2008, 07:50\nIn the pit of 402, Elevator 4\n\n\"Ravens 412, 402, heads up - two jets in for landing, you will taxi to cats after they have landed\".\n\n\"412\" - Prince replied. \n\nFlip looked to his right but couldn't make out two specks of incoming aircraft just yet, although he knew that Cajun was scheduled for a hop with Olive this morning. He returned to his routine cockpit checks...\n\n---------- DESIGNER'S NOTES ----------\n\n1. You are set to LATE ACTIVATION, so don't worry you're not there at the mission start.\n\n2. During takeoff, use CAT4 next to Prince. Deck crew will wait with hooking you up until 412 departs, so just wait. This is normal. \n\n3. Before the training fight with Prince, stay on his left wing. Then break east, after \"fight's on\" call perform side to side flyby, after which you can fight. Use SPACE BAR to simulate shooting both your AIM-9s when you have good tone. After each, break in opposite direction than Prince and fly for 30 seconds, until another fight's on call. \n\n4. Remember to use F10 radio menu to declare JOKER when you reach 7000 pounds! \n\n5. Estimated mission time: 90 minutes" : "此时Prince站起来开始任务简报。今天的飞行是他的分队指挥课程一部分，这意味着他将全程负责整个任务。他的主要目标是展示自己能够熟练执行任务所有环节：从任务简报到飞行执行，再到返航和任务讲评。他清了清嗓子开始说道：\n\n\"好，我们被分配到的飞机编号是402和412，停放在4号升降机。今天不使用战术呼号——所以我们将使用Raven 402和Raven 412。我们将在航母300度方位20海里处集结，然后爬升至18,000英尺高度，转向西南方向前往训练空域。\"\n\n他停顿了一下，看到Flip露出疑惑的表情问道：\"西南？\"\n\nPrince迟疑片刻，看向闭路电视屏幕。航母夜间已向南移动，位置与他昨天准备简报时不同。\n\n\"我们将在航路点2转向北，然后向西北方向飞行\"——他纠正道——\"今天的主要任务是1对1空战机动训练。我们将使用CATM-9训练弹和模拟机炮交战，直到一方达到JOKER燃油状态。标准程序：分离后做左/左或右/右对冲，然后开始交战。训练区域位于海湾中部，距离伊朗和沙特约50海里处。\"\n\n他停下来查看笔记，继续道：\n\n\"武器配置——每人两枚CATM-9训练弹，机炮不装弹。也不携带箔条/热焰弹。通讯——切换到STRIKE频率并保持飞行编队通讯。同时监听紧急频道。天气良好，任务区域无风无云，但我们当前位置以南预计有沙尘暴，以北有厚云层。凝结尾从28,000英尺开始形成。\"\n\nPrince再次停顿，翻过一页。\n\n\"现在说飞行计划。集结后我们以0.65马赫爬升至18,000英尺，在航路点2转向西北前往任务区域。交战前保持在我左侧编队位置。交战结束后，我们将爬升至28,000英尺以节省燃油，可能做些观光然后返回母舰。燃油——将JOKER设定为6,000磅。返航时加油机将在位待命。\"\n\n他最后看了眼笔记，看向Flip：\n\n\"我要说的就这些。有什么问题？\"\n\n\"有。关于训练部分：Hard Deck高度是多少？\"\n\n\"Hard Deck设定为5,000英尺。\"\n\n\"交战中每次命中后，我们要回到起始位置吗？\"\n\n\"不需要，我们会持续交战直到用响尾蛇或机炮取得3次命中。\"\n\n\"明白。开始吧。\"\n\n2008年2月17日星期二 07:50\n402号机驾驶舱，4号升降机\n\n\"Raven 412、402注意——两架飞机即将降落，等他们降落后你们再滑向弹射器。\"\n\n\"412收到\"——Prince回答。\n\nFlip向右望去还看不到 incoming 飞机的踪影，尽管他知道Cajun今早应该和Olive一起飞行。他继续着自己的驾驶舱检查程序......\n\n---------- 设计者说明 ----------\n\n1. 你被设置为延迟激活，所以不用担心任务开始时你不在场。\n\n2. 起飞时使用Prince旁边的4号弹射器。甲板人员会等412起飞后再为你挂弹射器，只需等待。这是正常程序。\n\n3. 与Prince进行训练战前，保持在他左侧编队位置。然后在\"fight's on\"指令后向东脱离，完成侧向对冲后开始交战。当获得良好音调时，使用空格键模拟发射两枚AIM-9导弹。每次射击后与Prince相反方向脱离，飞行30秒直到下一次\"fight's on\"指令。\n\n4. 记住当燃油达到7000磅时使用F10无线电菜单宣告JOKER！\n\n5. 预计任务时长：90分钟",

  "At this Prince stood up to conduct the brief. Today's sortie was part of his Flight Leader instruction, which meant that he was the one in charge of the whole sortie. His main goal was to show that he was capable of proficiently conducting all parts of the mission: starting from briefing, through flying it to recovery and debrief. He cleared his throat and began. \n\n\"OK, so we have been assigned aircraft numbers 402 and 412, parked on Elevator 4. We won't use a tactical call sign today - so we'll go as Raven 402 and Raven 412. We'll rendezvous at mother's 300 for 20, then climb to Angels 18 and turn southwest and make our way towards the training area.\"\n\nHe stopped, seeing a questioning look from Flip, who asked: \"Southwest?\"\n\nPrince hesitated, then looked at the CCTV screen. The ship had moved south overnight and was in a different spot than yesterday when he was preparing for the brief. \n\n\"We'll turn north and then move northwest at waypoint 2\" - he corrected himself - \"Our primary mission today will be a 1 v 1 air combat maneuvering training. To make things interesting, we will do only simulated gunfights until one of us reaches JOKER. Standard drill: cutaway, then left/left or right/right pass, after which the fight is on. Our operating area will be in the middle of the Gulf, around 50 miles between Iran and KSA\".\n\nHe paused to check his notes, then continued:\n\n\"Weapons - two CATM-9s each, practice tracer ammo loaded in the gun. No chaff or flares today. Comms - we'll switch to Strike on PRI 2 and stay on Flight AUX 1. We will also monitor Guard. Weather is good, no wind and no clouds in our AO, but expected sandstorm to the south and heavy clouds to the north of our current posit. Contrails starting around 28 000\".\n\nPrince stopped again, flicked a page.\n\n\"Now, flight planning. After join-up we will climb out at Mach 0.65 up to 18 000, then at WP 2 turn northwest and continue towards the AO. Stay on my left wing before the fight. After the fight, we'll climb to Angels 28 to conserve fuel, maybe do a little sightseeing and then head back to Mother. Fuel - let's set our Joker at 6000. Texaco will be on station during our recovery\".  \n\nHe glanced at his notes one more time, before looking at Flip:\n\n\"That's all from me. Any questions?\"\n\n\"Yes. For the training part: what is the Hard Deck?\"\n\n\"The Hard Deck is set to 5 000 feet\". \n\n\"During the fight, after each hit - do we go back to where we started?\"\n\n\"Negative, we fight until we score 3 hits. We have the Sidewinders, but let's do guns only\". \n\n\"Roger. Let's do it\". \n\nTuesday, 17/02/2008, 07:50\nIn the pit of 402, Elevator 4\n\n\"Ravens 412, 402, heads up - two jets in for landing, you will taxi to cats after they have landed\".\n\n\"412\" - Prince replied. \n\nFlip looked to his right but couldn't make out two specks of incoming aircraft just yet, although he knew that Cajun was scheduled for a hop with Olive this morning. He returned to his routine cockpit checks...\n\n---------- DESIGNER'S NOTES ----------\n1. Taxi after Prince to CAT 3 as directed, after you launch join up with him on track to WP2.\n\n-- DUE TO DCS BUG, DATALINK WITH PRINCE IS NOT WORKING CORRECTLY. YOU NEED TO SELECT HIM ON \"SA\" PAGE AND MARK HIM AS A MEMBER2 (Latter \"B\") - if Bug not present, You would be #2. (B) and him (A). --\n\n2. After rejoin Prince will tell to ENABLE GUARD. That means enabling monitoring of guard frequency on all channels (first option in UFC menu on the right), and not switching to Guard!\n\n3. Before the training fight with Prince, stay on his left wing and make sure you have set your Joker fuel 6000. For \"Cut Away\" Sout-East. After \"Fight's On\" call, turn North-East and perform side to side fly-by, the fight starts here. You will use only the gun today, so set Master Arm to ON and try to hit Prince normally. He will also try to hit you. Remember, this still is a simulated dogfight and your bullets wouldn't work against a real enemy. \n\n4. After the simualted dogfight is done, Prince will depart area to the MARSHAL waypoint while climbing to declared 28 000 feet. Prince will use MIL power setting to gain speed needed - he will slow down on top, here you can catch him without burnig precious fuel in on burner.\n\n5. Estimated mission time: 90 minutes" : "此时Prince起身开始任务简报。今天的飞行是他作为编队长的教学任务，意味着他将全程负责此次任务。他的主要目标是展示自己有能力熟练执行任务全流程：从任务简报到飞行实施，直至返航与任务总结。他清了清嗓子开始道：\n\n\"好的，我们分配到402和412号机，停放在4号升降机。今天不使用战术呼号——所以我们是Raven 402和Raven 412。我们将在航母300方位20海里处集结，爬升至18,000英尺后转向西南前往训练空域。\"\n\n他停顿下来，注意到Flip疑惑的表情：\"西南？\"\n\nPrince犹豫了一下，看向闭路监控屏幕。航母夜间已向南移动，位置与他昨天准备简报时不同。\n\n\"我们将在2号航路点向北转，然后向西北飞行\"——他更正道——\"今天的主要任务是1对1空战机动训练。为增加趣味性，我们只进行模拟机炮交战直到任意一方到达JOKER油量。标准流程：分离机动，然后左/左或右/右对冲，之后开始交战。训练区域设在波斯湾中部，距离伊朗和沙特约50海里处。\"\n\n他停顿查看笔记后继续：\n\n\"武器配置——每人两枚CATM-9训练弹，机炮装载示踪弹。今天不配备箔条/热焰弹。通讯——切换至PRI 2的Strike频率，保持Flight AUX 1。同时监听Guard频道。天气良好，任务区无风无云，但当前位置南侧预计有沙尘暴，北侧有厚云层。凝结尾约在28,000英尺出现。\"\n\nPrince再次停顿，翻动简报页。\n\n\"飞行计划。集结后以0.65马赫爬升至18,000英尺，在2号航路点转向西北前往任务区。交战前保持在我左侧编队。交战结束后爬升至28,000英尺节油，可能进行短暂观景后返回母舰。燃油——Joker设定为6,000磅。回收时Texaco加油机将在位待命。\"\n\n他最后瞥了眼笔记，看向Flip：\n\n\"我这边完毕。有问题吗？\"\n\n\"有。训练部分的Hard Deck高度是多少？\"\n\n\"Hard Deck设定为5,000英尺。\"\n\n\"交战中每次命中后要回到起始位置吗？\"\n\n\"不需要，直到累计三次命中。虽然携带了响尾蛇训练弹，但今天仅使用机炮。\"\n\n\"明白。开始吧。\"\n\n2008年2月17日 周二 07:50\n402号机驾驶舱，4号升降机\n\n\"Raven 412，402注意——两架进近着舰机，待其降落后你们将滑向弹射器。\"\n\n\"412收到。\"Prince回复。\n\nFlip向右望去还未能发现来机，尽管他知道Cajun今早应与Olive有飞行安排。他继续回到座舱检查程序...\n\n---------- 设计者说明 ----------\n1. 跟随Prince滑向3号弹射器，起飞后按航迹至WP2与他集结。\n\n-- 由于DCS系统BUG，与Prince的数据链无法正常运作。你需要在\"SA\"页面选择他并标记为MEMEBER2（对应\"B\"键）——若BUG不存在，你本应作为2号机(B)，他则是长机(A)。--\n\n2. 集结后Prince会指示ENABLE GUARD。这意味着在所有频道启用Guard频率监听（通过右侧UFC菜单首选项），而非切换至Guard频道！\n\n3. 与Prince进行训练对抗前，保持在其左侧编队并确认Joker燃油设为6,000磅。\"分离机动\"向东南。\"Fight's On\"指令后转向东北进行侧向对冲，交战由此开始。今日仅使用机炮，将主武器开关设为ON并正常瞄准Prince。他同样会攻击你。注意这仍是模拟对抗，你的子弹对真实敌机无效。\n\n4. 模拟对抗结束后，Prince将爬升至声明的28,000英尺高度向MARSHAL航路点脱离。Prince将使用军用推力加速——到达顶点后会减速，此时你可不使用加力追上以节省燃油。\n\n5. 预计任务时长：90分钟",

  "Alright, people. The ceremony starts in 30 minutes, and one hour from now we should be directly overhead mother in finger four formation. \n\nI am in 403, Psycho will take 410 and fly on my wing. Clam in 405 will fly as number 3, and Blade will go as dash 4 in 406. We will crank around 7:30, take off 5-7 minutes after that.\"\n\nFlip took black marker and sketched a simple outline of the ship on the whiteboard. Next he started to add more and more info as he spoke.\n\n\"Let's join up away from the ship on the way to waypoint 2, 210 radial at 30 miles, angels five. We'll stay outside 20 miles and circle there. Loose cruise, with you Psycho on my left. \n\nOnce I push toward the ship, snuggle up into finger-four parade and I'll take us down to 2500 feet at waypoint 3, and then 800 feet at 300 knots on the final leg. We should get to initial point around 3 minutes before 08:00. \n\nI'll call Tower and tell them we're inbound for the flyby, I'll call a \"see you\" at 10. Inside 10 miles I'll ease down to 800 feet and bring us up the wake on the port side. Just as we get to the fantail I'm going to look at you, Clam, and kiss you off. Gracefully lift the jet up, plug in the blowers, and ride it at 45 degrees nose up. If there's a cloud you can punch through, do it. The rest of us continue ahead, and Blade hold your position to maintain that hole. Clam, just before you run out of knots, recover and suck the engines to idle. Keep sight of us on the deck and float down on our bearing to join, trying to stay quiet inside 5 miles from mother. We'll come back overhead at recovery time and come into the break in twos, first me and Psycho, then Clam and  Blade. We might be landing into the sun, so be extra careful. \n\nWe have no weapons except a pair of CATM-9s each - no flares and no ammo. We do have two tanks each though - at least we won't have to worry about the fuel and we should still be below our max trap weight on recovery. As for comms, we'll stay on our flight freq at all times and switch to Tower, then Marshal on pri. The weather is fine, moderate wind and some scattered clouds. Anything for me? Okay, ready, break.\"\n\n---------- DESIGNER'S NOTES ----------\n\n1. Radio checks should be performed when you are ready to taxi. Other flights will start taxiing starting from 30s mark after radio check. 410 will only start taxiing once you depart.\n\n2. Stay around or slightly above 800 feet during the final leg, below that altitude AI tends to jump up and down.\n\n3. Remember to press SPACE BAR or I/R to detach Clam for missing man.\n\n4.

  "Thursday, 19/02/2008,07:00\nValley Forge, Persian Gulf (26 12N, 52 43E)\n\nAs most of the Air Wing pilots were gathering in Hangar Bay 2 for Lt. Ramer Howard  memorial service, Flip and three other aviators met in Ready Room 7 to plan for probably the most resented revered type of mission to be flown by fighter pilots: the missing man formation.\n\nIt is a special aerial salute dating back as early as 1936, usually flown to commemorate a fallen comrade or some important figure. Prince was not the best nor the most popular pilot in the squadron, but he was one of them: a Hornet driver, their brother in arms and finally a Raven. He deserved to have the best farewell they could offer.\n\nBesides Flip, also present in the room were Psycho, Clam and Blade. This time there would be no CVIC general briefing, so they just noted down ship's position, checked the weather information and then gathered in front of a whiteboard." : "2008年2月19日 星期四 07:00\n波斯湾 福吉谷号航母 (北纬26度12分 东经52度43分)\n\n当联队大多数飞行员聚集在二号机库参加拉默·霍华德中尉追悼仪式时，Flip与其他三名飞行员在七号简报室筹备这场战斗机飞行员最肃穆的任务：缺席者编队飞行。\n\n这种特殊空中礼仪式可追溯至1936年，通常用于纪念阵亡战友或重要人物。Prince既非中队最优秀也非最受欢迎的飞行员，但他是其中一员：大黄蜂驾驶员、他们的战友、最终成为Raven的一员。他理应获得他们所能给予的最高规格告别。\n\n除Flip外，Psycho、Clam和Blade也参与了筹备。这次没有航母情报中心的综合简报，他们仅记录了舰船位置，查看了气象信息，随后聚集在白板前。",

  "Flip got up from his chair in the first row and turned to face the others. Psycho was flying off his wing on this sortie, and there were also Clam and Little Nicky on Alert-30 as Raven 21. \n\"Alright, welcome back to the Gulf. Less than a month ago we were asked by our allies in the region to quietly leave until things calmed down. As that was not the case  and all the sabre rattling from Tehran made them plea for us to return. The plan is to keep our presence low level, with mainly training sorties over international waters and alert aircraft ready to launch at all times. \n\nI'll be in 400, get to fly the CAG's bird, Psycho - you have 410, both parked in the Corral next to Clam's and Nicky's jets. We're Raven 11, Clam - you are Raven 21. We will walk at 07:45, plan to crank shortly after 08:00 and launches are scheduled 5-10 minutes after that. Let's join at 280 radial at 15 miles and then continue to the training area.\n\nOur primary mission is live munitions training, we will practice dropping Rockeyes  in CCIP mode. Once we get on station, you \" - Flip pointed at Psycho - \"will drop a marker on the surface. Then we will make two passes each, releasing one bomb per pass on the smoke. After that we'll do some high and low angle strafing.\n\nSecondary task is to react to any provocations or aggressive actions by the Iranians and to protect the Strike Group. We will be working with Knight and Strike in case anything happens.\n\nWe will remain on station until Strike tells us to RTB, if we need to get a drink in the meantime - we will.  \n\nWeapons. We'll set up our Mk20s on station. Manual fuze, height to 1200,CCIP mode. For the gun, we'll do 15, 30 and 45 degree runs. We're also carrying 2 AIM-120s and two Sidewinders each plus Mk58 marine markers. If there is trouble or we need to expedite to another location, we'll jettison the bombs after checking it is safe to do so and there is no maritime traffic in the immediate vicinity. \n\nFinally, the emergencies. Our divert for today is Al Dhafra Air Base, which will be approximately 100 miles to the southeast from our operating area. Set ladder to 5000, tank to 3000. We're carrying live bombs and live gun, so we'll need to bring it back to the ship - no diverts.\n\nRemember, Iranians are NOT happy to see us back here and it is likely they will try to do something stupid. This time, however, we will be prepared. Anything for me?\"\n\nOthers shook their heads.\n\n\"OK, ready, break.\"\n\n---------- DESIGNER'S NOTES ----------\n\n1. Perform the radio checks once you are ready to taxi, as Psycho will move to her CAT soon after. \n\nEstimated mission time: 85 minutes" : "FLIP从第一排座位上起身，转身面对其他人。本轮任务由\"精神病人\"担任他的僚机，而\"CLAM\"和\"LITTLE NICKY\"作为Raven 21编队处于30分钟警戒状态。\n\"好，欢迎回到波斯湾。不到一个月前，我们应地区盟友要求低调撤离等待局势降温。现在情况有变——德黑兰方面持续剑拔弩张，他们又恳请我们回来。计划是保持低调存在，主要在国际水域进行训练飞行，同时保持警戒战机随时待命。\n\n我将驾驶400号机，这可是联队长的座驾。\"精神病人\"你飞410号，这两架都和\"CLAM\"、\"LITTLE NICKY\"的飞机停在Corral区。我们是Raven 11编队，\"CLAM\"你们是Raven 21。07:45开始滑行，计划08:00后启动引擎，五到十分钟内依次弹射。我们在15海里280径向线集结，然后前往训练空域。\n\n主要任务是实弹训练，用CCIP模式投掷石眼集束炸弹。就位后\"——FLIP指向\"精神病人\"——\"你先投掷水面标识弹。然后每人进行两轮投弹，每次对着烟幕投放一枚炸弹。接着进行高低角度机炮扫射训练。\n\n次要任务是应对伊朗方面的任何挑衅行为，保护STRIKE。如有突发情况，我们将与\"KNIGHT\"和\"STRIKE\"分队协同作战。\n\n我们将保持战位直到\"STRIKE\"分队通知返航，期间如需空中加油会另行安排。\n\n武器配置：MK20炸弹设置手动引信，起爆高度1200英尺，CCIP模式。机炮训练采用15度、30度和45度俯冲角。每机携带两枚AIM-120、两枚响尾蛇导弹及MK58海上标识弹。若遇紧急情况需快速转移，在确认安全且周边无船只后可以抛弃炸弹。\n\n应急方案：今日备降场是阿尔达夫拉空军基地，位于训练区东南约100海里处。阶梯高度设为5000英尺，加油高度3000英尺。注意我们携带实弹，必须带回航母——禁止备降。\n\n记住，伊朗人对我们重返该海域非常不满，很可能会做出愚蠢举动。但这次我们准备充分。有问题吗？\"\n\n众人摇头。\n\n\"好，准备解散。\"\n\n---------- 设计师注释 ----------\n\n1. 滑行前完成无线电检查，\"精神病人\"会立即前往弹射位。\n\n预计任务时长：85分钟",
  "The shoot-down death of an American fighter pilot over Iranian soil was front page news all over the world. The story generated predictable glee in many African, Middle Eastern, and Asian communities, and indifferent resignation in other parts of the globe. The incident had now resulted in a diplomatic fight between Washington and Tehran, and the Iranians, masters at exploiting American misfortune, had the upper hand. While Washington issued a public apology for the violation of Iranian airspace, its expressions of dismay at the unprovoked downing of an incapacitated airman without warning after repeated calls to this fact on international radio distress channels was met worldwide by skepticism, if not disbelief. Many nations viewed the incident as an American probe, or as a precursor to a wider war with Iran, which in some Washington circles was viewed as inevitable. The GCC nations, always wary of their northern neighbor, quietly asked Washington to tone down their profile in the Gulf and to give assurances that this was not a sign of an American attack.\n\nTherefore, two days after Lt Ramer Howard was shot down, USS Valley Forge set course for the Gulf of Oman, where Air Wing 4 flew sorties in support of NATO ISAF in Afghanistan. However, it quickly became evident that Tehran capitalized on the lack of American presence to step up operations in the Gulf, hindering free movement of civilian traffic and taking provocative actions against Saudi Arabia and UAE. As a result, the very same GCC states asked Washington to step up US military presence in the region. And so on 9 March Valley Forge transited through the Strait of Hormuz on the westerly course once again...\n\n10/03/2008, 06:45\nUSS Valley Forge, Ready Room 7\n\nGroup of aviators assembled in the room watched the CCTV screen, waiting for the briefing to start. CSG-4 was going at flank speed all night, and now - after exiting the SoH at 0300 -  was ready to commence the first morning sorties. At precisely 0645, the familiar face of a female CVIC officer appeared on the screen.\n\n\"Good morning Tomahawk, I am lieutenant jay gee Helen McHardy, and welcome to the event one brief. CSG-4 is back in the Persian Gulf and will resume conducting operations in support of our forces in Iraq, as well as ensuring freedom of navigation and the free transit of civilian shipping in the gulf\".\n\nRaven pilots and Marines from the Moonshadows listening to this briefing knew very well that Iraq was not going to be very high on the agenda, given the recent tensions and Iranian actions in the region.\n\n\"The weather conditions are good, with clear skies, visibility greater than 10 miles and moderate winds from the north - west. The temperature is 70 degrees Fahrenheit. \n\nIntelligence update. In recent weeks Islamic Republic of Iran naval forces conducted numerous operations stopping tankers transiting the Persian Gulf, conducting prolonged searches and document checks. The Iranian Air Force breached airspace of Oman, UAE and Saudi Arabia on several occasions and keeps CAP flights up around the clock. It is likely that provocations against our Group - like the one with the Fencer from one month ago - may be attempted, therefore USS Valley Forge will maintain aircraft on Alert-30 at all times.\n\nEvent 1 launches will begin at 08:07 with recoveries expected as of 09:15. Ship's current position is 25 28 North, 53 56 East, and estimated location during recovery should be 25 34N, 53 47E. CSG-4 will continue on its current course, heading northwest. The divert field for today is Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates. \n\nRules of Engagement are as follows:\n- Do not enter airspace of any country without specific agreement. Steer clear of airspace and territorial waters of any country except Al Dhafra Air Base if you are told to divert. This is especially important following the recent incident over Iran and heightened tensions in the region.\n- Weapons hold unless instructed otherwise by Strike or Wizard. In an event of hostile fire, evade and report back to the ship. \n\nThat is all from my side, have a good flight\"." : "一名美国战斗机飞行员在伊朗领空被击毙的新闻登上了全球各大报纸头条。这起事件在非洲、中东和亚洲许多地区引发了预料之中的欢呼，而世界其他地区则表现出漠然的顺从。该事件已导致华盛顿与德黑兰之间爆发外交争端，擅长利用美国不幸事件的伊朗人占据了上风。尽管华盛顿就侵犯伊朗领空一事公开道歉，但针对伊朗在国际无线电遇险频道反复申明情况下仍无预警击落丧失作战能力飞行员的暴行所表达的愤慨，在全球范围内遭到怀疑甚至否定。许多国家将此事件视为美国的试探行为，或是与伊朗全面战争的前兆——华盛顿某些圈层认为这场战争不可避免。海湾合作委员会国家始终对北方邻国保持警惕，他们私下要求华盛顿降低在波斯湾的存在感，并要求美方保证这并非美国发动攻击的信号。\n\n因此，在拉默·霍华德中尉被击落两天后，\"福吉谷\"号航空母舰驶向阿曼湾，第4航空联队在该区域执行支援北约驻阿富汗国际安全援助部队的飞行任务。然而很快显而易见的是，德黑兰利用美军缺席的时机加强了在波斯湾的行动，不仅阻碍民用船只自由通行，还对沙特阿拉伯和阿联酋采取挑衅行动。结果，正是这些海湾合作委员会国家要求华盛顿增强美军在该地区的存在。于是3月9日，\"福吉谷\"号再次取道霍尔木兹海峡向西航行......\n\n2008年3月10日06:45\n\"福吉谷\"号航母7号待命室\n\n聚集在待命室的机组人员注视着闭路电视屏幕，等待任务简报开始。第4航母战斗群全速航行整夜后，于凌晨三点驶离霍尔木兹海峡，现已准备展开清晨的首轮飞行任务。06:45整，屏幕上出现一位女性航母情报中心军官熟悉的面容。\n\n\"早上好'战斧'们，我是海军上尉海伦·麦克哈迪，欢迎参加第一轮任务简报。第4航母战斗群重返波斯湾，将继续执行支援驻伊拉克部队的行动，同时确保海湾地区的航行自由与民用船只通畅通行。\"\n\n聆听简报的\"Raven\"中队飞行员和\"Moonshadows\"陆战队员都心知肚明，考虑到近期紧张局势和伊朗在该地区的行动，伊拉克任务根本不会成为优先事项。\n\n\"气象条件良好，晴空万里，能见度超过10英里，西北风中等强度，气温华氏70度（约21摄氏度）。\n\n情报更新：近几周伊朗伊斯兰共和国海军部队多次拦截通过波斯湾的油轮，进行长时间搜查和文件检查。伊朗空军数次侵犯阿曼、阿联酋和沙特领空，并保持24小时战斗空中巡逻。类似一个月前与'Fencer'相遇的针对我战斗群的挑衅行为可能再次发生，因此'福吉谷'号将始终保持'30分钟警戒'战机待命状态。\n\n首轮出击将于08:07开始，预计09:15开始回收。航母当前坐标北纬25度28分，东经53度56分；预计回收时坐标北纬25度34分，东经53度47分。第4航母战斗群将继续沿西北航向行进。今日备降场为阿联酋阿尔达夫拉空军基地。\n\n交战规则如下：\n- 未经特别许可不得进入任何国家领空。除接到备降指令外，必须远离所有国家领空和领海——鉴于近期伊朗上空事件及该地区紧张局势升级，这点尤为重要。\n- 除非'STRIKE'或'Wizard'另有指令，否则保持武器锁定状态。若遭遇敌对火力，规避并立即向母舰报告。\n\n简报完毕，祝飞行顺利。\"",

  "Second Part (Briefing)\n\nThursday, 13 March 2008\n18:20, Ready Room \n\nThe telephone on the desk of duty officer rang, piercing the otherwise quiet room, not counting the monotonous humming of ship's machinery. Sponge Bob, who was the duty officer, picked it up almost immediately. Flip and Olive - only other people present in the room - lifted their heads and looked at one another before turning their gaze to lieutenant junior grade, who listened for a while before saying: \"Roger that, I'll pass it on\". After hanging up, he looked at his OPSO and said:\n\n\"Sir, you're going up, They will announce Alert 30 in a moment\". Flip, they're calling away the alert 30 SUCAP!\"\n\n\"Thanks. Do you know what this is about?\".\n\n\"Negative, but it sure doesn't look like a drill to me\".\n\nBefore Flip could respond, ship's 1MC came to life:\n\n\"This is the TAO. Now launch the alert 30 SUCAP. Now launch the alert 30 SUCAP!\"\n\nThey immediately got up and ran out of the room.\n\n***\n\n\nThursday, 13 March 2008\n18:28, Flight Deck\n\nFlip stopped next to the ladder to 403 when he saw Cajun trotting along the flight deck towards him. He saluted.\n\n\"Skipper! Do we know what is going on?\" - they had to shout in order to be heard due to the wind sweeping over the deck and noise made by Switchblade, SAR helicopter getting on station overhead. \n\n\"Yes. Iranians made a move against USS Richard Best in the Strait of Hormuz and attacked her with fast movers. From what we know they took some damage and are DIW, they may need help if the attackers return!\"\n\n\"Whoa!\" \n\n\"Exactly. Be smart and good hunting!\"\n\n\"Will do, Skipper!\"\n\n---------- DESIGNER'S NOTES ----------\n\nOlive will start up as soon as you perform Radio Checks.\nWait for Olive on the CAT and then let her rejoin, don't make her chase you. Alternatively, after takeoff make a circle and wait for her to take off. \n\nDo not start taxiing before you get the SPACE BAR option to perform radio checks.\n\nEstimated mission time: 80 minutes" : "第二部分（任务简报）\n\n2008年3月13日 星期四\n18:20 待命室\n\n值班军官桌上的电话突然响起，刺破了原本只有舰船设备单调嗡鸣的寂静。担任值班军官的\"海绵宝宝\"立即接起电话。房间里仅有的另外两人——\"Flip\"和\"OLIVE\"——抬头对视一眼，随后将目光投向这位海军少尉。少尉听了一阵后说道：\"收到，我马上传达\"。挂断电话后，他看着作战官说：\n\n\"长官，您要出击了。马上会发布30分钟警戒通告。\"\"Flip\"，他们在召唤30分钟警戒SUCAP战机！\"\n\n\"谢谢。知道具体情况吗？\"\n\n\"不清楚，但看起来不像是演习\"。\n\n\"Flip\"还没来得及回应，舰内广播系统突然响起：\n\n\"这里是战术行动官。立即启动30分钟警戒SUCAP。立即启动30分钟警戒SUCAP！\"\n\n他们立即起身冲出房间。\n\n***\n\n2008年3月13日 星期四\n18:28 飞行甲板\n\n\"Flip\"在403号舷梯旁停下脚步，看见\"CAJUN人\"正沿着飞行甲板向他小跑而来。他立即敬礼。\n\n\"队长！知道发生什么了吗？\"——由于甲板上呼啸的海风和头顶\"Switchblade\"搜救直升机就位的轰鸣，他们不得不提高嗓门。\n\n\"知道。伊朗人在霍尔木兹海峡对'理查德·贝斯特'号采取了行动，用高速战机发动了攻击。据我们所知他们受了些损伤，现在已经失去航行能力，如果攻击者再来可能需要支援！\"\n\n\"哇哦！\"\n\n\"没错。保持警惕，祝狩猎顺利！\"\n\n\"明白，队长！\"\n\n---------- 设计师备注 ----------\n\n完成无线电检查后，\"OLIVE\"会立即启动。\n请在弹射器上等待\"OLIVE\"，让她完成编队，不要让她追赶你。或者起飞后盘旋等待她起飞。\n\n在获得空格键无线电检查选项前，请不要开始滑行。\n\n预计任务时间：80分钟",

  "Wednesday, 12 March 2008\n17:33, Ready Room 7\n\nFlip and Olive went through all the routine steps in preparation for standing the Alert-30: they wrote down Air Ops Info, checked the air plan, got the cards of the day, signed for their jets in Maintenance Control, then preflighted them. After that they went to the Ready Room. Wilson took out a map of part of the Gulf they were currently in - Valley Forge was passing around 25 miles from Dubai - and began the briefing. \n\n\"Okay, alert 30, the ship is MODLOC'ed at our present lat/long, weather OK with some scattered clouds. I'm in 403, you're in 410. My jet is parked on elevator 4, yours aft of the elevator 3. Both are loaded with two Mavericks. If they call away the alert let's run to get dressed and to the jet. Start and taxi standard, let's get a comm check on both radios. Combat checklist on deck. Remember, off the cat turn in the nearest direction to the threat and we'll join en route if we can. If they shoot us off two cats and it looks close for whoever is off second, then the first off float your turn so the second can join and we can affect the intercept with section integrity. If they shoot the alert Knight with us we'll probably work under their control but we'll let Strike assign us. Olive, I'll wait for you to rejoin keeping below 350 knots. When we're together, fence checks on my mark. \n\nThe tactical situation is as follows: we have one of our escorts 20 miles further up north - east along the coast and three US frigates next to us in plane guard plus USS Richard Best transiting Hormuz as we speak\". \n\nFlip gestured over the map, marking position of allied vessels with his fingers. \n\n\"Now on to possible airborne threats. After Prince was shot down Iranians are keeping a rather low profile and we shouldn't expect anything different tonight. Still, stay alert and be extra careful - we cannot rule out another surprise attack. We will sort any problems directly with Strike.\n\nIf we're up against surface threats, unless they are attacking civilian vessel or any other ship, we will try to birddog them and force them to retreat. If they are using deadly force, we will check with Strike and wait for guidance, we're still operating under peacetime ROE. Going to adapt to what we find. \n\nWe're operating close to UAE and we should try not to enter their airspace so let's stay out of their airspace, although since they are having their own trouble with the Iranians, I don't think they would get too upset. We should also watch out not to get too close to Iranian islands to the north and north - west. \n\nIf we have to take off during dawn, we'll check the NVGs and verify if they are usable or not. \n\nDown plane/ SAR. We're close to UAE territorial waters and our own assets, so there should be plenty of assets available. I've got you, you've got me, break out the SAR checklist. The water is not that cold, anyway\". \n\nFlip paused to take a deep breath, looking through his notes.\n\n\"OK. Keep track of the ship and let's get back here with no less than 3.0 min first pass fuel. Listen up if they launch a tanker. If it's light enough for Case 1, Standard check in with Marshal, see the ship at ten and switch tower, I'll bring us overhead and if the deck's clear with the lens on I'll bring us through the initial, get yourself in parade, break at the bow, you break 17 seconds later, good abeam at 600 feet, 450 at the ninety, 375 as you pick up the ball, aggressive corrections early, look for cut lights, trap. If still night Case 3, then I'll kiss you off so you can check in with marshal and get your approach instructions on your own.\n\nQuestions? No? Good. Okay, let's do it!\" " : "2008年3月12日 星期三\n17:33 第七待命室\n\nFlip和Olive完成了所有战备30分钟警戒状态的例行步骤：记录航空作战信息、检查飞行计划、领取当日任务卡片、在维修控制室签收战机并进行飞行前检查。随后他们来到待命室。Wilson摊开当前海湾区域的海图——\"Valley Forge\"号航母正在迪拜附近25英里海域航行——开始任务简报。\n\n\"好，30分钟警戒状态，母舰当前坐标已锁定，天气良好伴有零星云层。我驾驶403号机，你驾驶410号机。我的战机停在4号升降机旁，你的在3号升降机后方。两机均挂载两枚小牛导弹。若拉响警报，我们立即着装登机。标准程序启动滑行，双电台通讯检查。作战检查单就位。记住，弹射起飞后朝威胁方向最近转向，争取途中完成编队。若双弹射器同时弹射且第二架可能滞后，第一架应保持转向弧度让第二架加入，确保编队完整实施拦截。若与Knight警戒机组同时起飞，我们可能受其指挥，但具体由Strike分配。Olive，我会保持350节以下速度等你集结。完成编队后，听我指令进行防线检查。\n\n战术态势如下：我方一艘护航舰艇位于东北方向20英里沿岸海域，三艘美军护卫舰执行平面警戒任务，USS理查德·贝斯特号此刻正通过霍尔木兹海峡。\"\n\nFlip用手指在海图上标出盟军舰船位置。\n\n\"接下来是可能的空中威胁。自Prince被击落后伊朗人保持低调，今晚应该也不例外。但仍需保持高度警惕——不能排除再次遭遇突袭的可能。所有问题直接与Strike协调解决。\n\n若遭遇水面威胁，除非对方攻击民用船只或其他舰艇，我们优先实施监控驱离。若对方使用致命武力，需请示Strike等待指示——我们仍处于和平时期交战规则。具体应对视情况调整。\n\n行动区域靠近阿联酋领空，尽量避免侵入其空域。不过鉴于他们正与伊朗存在摩擦，估计反应不会太激烈。同时注意避开西北方向的伊朗岛屿群。\n\n若需黎明时分起飞，需检查夜视镜是否可用。\n\n迫降/搜救预案：我们靠近阿联酋领海且有友军单位支援，救援资源充足。我掩护你，你掩护我，启动搜救检查单。反正水温不算太低。\"\n\nFlip停顿片刻翻看笔记。\n\n\"注意保持与母舰距离，第一波次返航时燃油不得低于3.0分钟。留意加油机出动情况。若符合Case 1条件，标准程序联系Marshal，十海里目视舰艇后切换塔台通讯。我会带我们飞越甲板，若甲板畅通且光学助降系统就位，将引导进入初始航线。你保持编队姿态，舰艏处开始分离，你延迟17秒脱离。600英尺高度完成侧飞，90度转向时降至450英尺，捕捉到球时保持375英尺，及早修正姿态，注意切断灯信号，着舰。若夜间执行Case 3，我会示意你单独联系Marshal获取进近指令。\n\n有问题吗？没有？好，开始行动！\"",

  "[Before flying this mission, it is advised to read Chapter 47 of \"Raven One\" novel]\n\nUSS Valley Forge\nLCDR Wilson's Stateroom\n03:15 AM\n\nRelentless ringing of the telephone woke him up. Still half asleep, Flip glanced at the alarm clock - 03:15. Strike planning was scheduled for 0900... He reached out and grabbed the handle.\n\n\"Wilson.\"\n\n\"Sir\" - Lt JG Fagan's voice was apologetic but alarmed. He was this night's duty officer  - \"Skipper wants to see you in CVIC at 03:30. Sounds important.\"\n\n\"Thanks\" - he hung up the phone and crawled out of bed.\n\n\"What's up, Flip?\" - Weed asked from his top bunk.\n\n\"Nttty just rousted me to join the skipper in CVIC.\"\n\n\"Whoa! What's up?\"\n\n\"He didn't tell me. Something just happened.\"\n\n\"I'll join you.\"\n\nUSS Valley Forge\nCVIC\n03:28 AM\n\n\"Flip. Good to see you\" - Cajun gestured for Wilson to take place beside him next to a large table covered with maps of the Gulf and reconnaissance photos. Three men were bent over the charts and Flip immediately recognized Capt Vincent Allen - Tomahawk's DCAG - among them. This indeed had to be important. The other two were carrier and air wing Intel Officers. Allen nodded at Wilson and said:\n\n\"Gentlemen, we have a very delicate situation on our hands. What follows is on a strict \"need-to-know\" level. After the attack on the Richard Best, we began planning a retaliatory strike - setting it up will be our main task for today. However, yesterday a decision was made to insert a SOF team on Siri island, tasked with disabling the Iranian long-range search radar and thus degrading our enemy ability to react to our attack on Bandar Abbas. The SEALs completed their objective, but then came in contact with enemy troops and had to lay low, missing their ride out on a sub.\n\nI think you can imagine political fallout if Iranians capture a whole team of our special forces. It is crucial that we extract them before that happens, and before more troops arrive on Siri. Your task, gentlemen, will be to quickly put together a plan on how to do that. Time is short. Steve, when do you think you'll be ready to launch?\"\n\n\"Before 06:30\".\n\n\"Good. Make this happen. Keep me and CAG posted. Lieutenant Commander Gant will fill you in on all intelligence details we currently have\".\n\nWhen Capt Allen left the room, a whole whirlwind of activities began.

  "USS Valley Forge\nCVIC\n05:25 AM\n\nThe plan was ready by 0500. A team that was chosen to fly this mission, chosen by Flip, that consisted of himself, Dutch, Little Nicky, and Sponge Bob. Presently, they were going through all the details one last time before going to the jets, which were being readied by the deck crew.\n\n\"Nicky and Bob, you'll go as Raven 11 in 402 and 411. Dutch will take 407, I am in 403, all four are parked in Corral. We will get to our planes at 0600, get ready to launch around 0620 in the following order: Nicky, Bob, myself, and Dutch. We'll meet up at waypoint 1, and on my mark, our package will push towards Siri - which we will call \"Mordor\" from now on\".\n\nFlip pulled up a recon photo of the island containing hand-drawn markings and notes (screen 6).\n\n\"Our mission is to coordinate extraction of Venom, a SOF team which was tasked with disabling search radar on Mordor. They were successful but didn't manage to leave the AO as they came under intense hostile fire. They have fallen back, found a bed down position, and are laying low. We don't know their exact location, but the next radio contact is scheduled for 06:15, so we should get an update en route. However, before we get there, we will need to get rid of at least one SA-15 - code name \"Tin Can\" - reportedly positioned not far from the now in-op radar, somewhere on the western part of the island\". Flip pointed to two black Xs marked on the map.\n\n\"This will be the job of Raven 11. Once you visually acquire Tin Can, launch a volley of Mavericks. 15s are pretty adept in shooting down missiles, so give her at least three in short succession. Also, transmit her exact coordinates to USS Robert Grady - our backup plan will be to fire a couple of Tomahawks to take her out if Mavs fail. As soon as the site is destroyed, you will move north and fly BARCAP in order to give us some breathing space. \n\nIn the meantime, Dutch and I  will get on station over Mordor and contact Venom. We will identify a suitable landing spot for Switchblade 31, disable any AAA in the vicinity, coordinate the extraction and then get out of there. Switchblade - one SH-60 - will be launched from USS Robert Grady, which is steaming towards the island as we speak. \n\nWe should have enough gas to remain on station for around 45 minutes and there may be no time to get a drink after the action starts, especially when Iranians get the idea of what we're up to. As far as we know, Iranian fighters are all stationed deep in-land in Shiraz and Bushier, which should give us an ample window of opportunity. There is a landing strip on Mordor, but no interceptors were spotted there. Another one is 26 miles to the east in Harad, but likewise - we didn't detect any fighters, only transport helicopters, and small civilian airplanes. \n\nWe don't have accurate data on enemy ground forces present in either location. Our intel estimates that on Mordor there are no more than two platoons of infantry with small arms and light AAA - possibly ZU-23 and ZSU-23s and some APCs, with similar assets in Harad. These would most likely be stationed near the airport.\" - Flip indicated a circle with his finger around the airstrip on the map. \n\n\"Now, weapons. Nicky and Sponge Bob will be loaded with two AGM-65F's, two AMRAAMS, and two AIM-9Ms each. Dutch, you and I will have one AGM-65 F each, we will also carry GBU-12s - I'll go with three in double - ugly configuration. For the codes, I will set 1688 for mine, Dutch - use 1686. We also have a full ammo load for the gun, ATFLIR, and two AIM-9Ms. We will arm our weapons once we get on station after Tin Can is destroyed. Raven 11 will shoot their Mavericks and then take CAP with AMRAAMS and Sidewinders. \n\nAs for the comms, frequencies are listed on the kneeboard. We'll do standard checks on deck, then switch to Strike en route for any updates on Venom and their exact position. We will then try to raise them on PRI, while staying on our flight freq on Aux at all times. Venom has already been authenticated and will be given a new frequency to monitor - one on which we will raise them.\n\nWeather is good, moderate winds and clear sky, the seas are calm. In case of trouble, our alternate for today is Al Dhafra Air Base. \n\nOK, a word on ROE. For ground targets, we will do whatever Venom needs us to do in order to get them out safely. We will also need to secure the landing zone for Switchblade - that means taking out any air defenses in the area. As for bandits, here the ROE is clear - we can use lethal force only when shot at, when they attack Venom, or there is a direct threat to Switchblade that will compromise the mission. \n\nFinally - the sooner we get in and out of the AO, the better. Anything for me? Good. Let's go.\"    \n\n---------- DESIGNER'S NOTES ----------\n\n1. Your aircraft will be activated 1s after start of the mission.\n\n2.  Perform radio checks on deck when you are ready to taxi. Your wingman will start taxiing around 40s after you press SPACE BAR. Wait for Raven 11 to start taxiing before that. \n\n3. During the mission and talk-on Venom's position, if you can't locate described location don't worry and move to next instructions. You will eventually be able to find him.\n\n4. If you  fail to hit the intended target, you are free to reattack without waiting for Venom's instruction to do so and using weapons of your choice. If (unlikely but happens) your wingman fails to hit, you may need to take out his target too.\n\n5. Estimated mission time: 90 minutes " : "USS 福吉谷号航母\nCVIC\n上午05:25\n\n行动计划已在0500准备就绪。由Flip亲自挑选的任务机组包括他本人、Dutch、Little Nicky和Sponge Bob。此刻他们正进行起飞前的最终任务简报，甲板人员正在为战机做准备工作。\n\n\"Nicky和Bob，你们将驾驶402和411号机组成Raven 11编队。Dutch驾驶407号机，我驾驶403号机，四架飞机都停在Corral区。0600就位，预计0620按以下顺序起飞：Nicky、Bob、我、Dutch。在1号航路点汇合，听我指令向Siri岛推进——从现在起我们称该岛为'Mordor'\"。\n\nFlip调出标注着手绘标记和笔记的岛屿侦察照片（屏幕6）。\n\n\"任务目标是协调撤离代号'VENOM'的特种部队，他们原本负责瘫痪Mordor岛上的搜索雷达。任务虽成功，但在撤离时遭遇猛烈火力压制。现已在交战区找到隐蔽点潜伏。具体位置不明，下次无线电联络定于0615，飞行途中会获得更新情报。但抵达前需先解决至少一个SA-15防空系统——代号'罐头'——据报位于瘫痪雷达站不远的岛屿西部\"。Flip指向地图上两个黑色X标记。\n\n\"这是Raven 11的任务。目视确认'罐头'后立即发射多枚小牛导弹。SA-15擅长拦截导弹，至少要连续发射三枚。同时将其精确坐标传送给USS罗伯特·格雷迪号——备用方案是发射战斧导弹进行打击。目标摧毁后立即向北移动执行BARCAP任务，为我们创造安全空域。\n\n与此同时，Dutch和我将在Mordor岛上空建立战场控制，联络'VENOM'。我们将确定适合Switchblade 31直升机降落的区域，清除周边防空火力，协调撤离后迅速离场。Switchblade——一架SH-60——正从全速驶向该岛的USS罗伯特·格雷迪号起飞。\n\n我们携带的燃料可维持约45分钟战场停留，行动开始后可能没时间空中加油，特别是伊朗方面察觉我方意图后。据情报，伊朗战机均部署在内陆的设拉子和布什尔，这提供了充足行动窗口。Mordor岛上有跑道但未发现截击机，26英里外的哈拉德另有机场，同样只发现运输直升机和小型民用飞机。\n\n缺乏敌方地面部队精确情报。预估Mordor岛驻军不超过两个步兵排，配备轻武器及ZU-23/ZSU-23防空炮与装甲车，哈拉德驻军规模类似，主要驻防机场周边。\"——Flip用手指圈出地图上的跑道区域。\n\n\"武器配置：Nicky和Sponge Bob各带两枚AGM-65F、两枚AMRAAM和两枚AIM-9M。Dutch和我各带一枚AGM-65F，我机将挂载三枚GBU-12——采用双联非常规挂载。激光编码设定：我机1688，Dutch使用1686。另备满弹机炮、ATFLIR吊舱和两枚AIM-9M。摧毁'罐头'就位后再解除武器保险。Raven 11发射小牛导弹后，用AMRAAM和响尾蛇执行CAP任务。\n\n通信频率详见膝板图表。甲板标准检查后，飞行途中切换至Strike频道接收'VENOM'位置更新。主用频率联系目标时，全程守听辅助频率。'VENOM'已完成身份验证，将获指定守听频率。\n\n天气良好，和风晴空，海况平稳。紧急备降场为阿尔达夫拉空军基地。\n\n交战规则说明：地面目标方面全力配合'VENOM'撤离需求，同时确保Switchblade着陆区安全——即清除区域防空火力。对空中目标，唯有在遭遇攻击、'VENOM'受袭或Switchblade面临直接威胁危及任务时方可使用致命武力。\n\n最后强调：越快进出任务区越好。有问题吗？很好，出发。\"\n\n---------- 设计者说明 ----------\n\n1. 任务开始1秒后激活战机\n2. 滑行准备就绪时进行甲板无线电检查。按空格键约40秒后僚机开始滑行，注意先等待Raven 11开始移动\n3. 任务中引导定位'VENOM'时若无法确认描述位置，可继续执行后续指令，最终能成功定位\n4. 未命中目标可自主决定再次攻击，无需等待'VENOM'指令。若僚机攻击失败（概率低但存在），可能需要接管其目标\n5. 预计任务时长：90分钟",

  "Once the spy finished, Cajun resumed his brief and, for the next hour, led the aviators through the step-by-step details of the mission. With a press of a button, the Air Tasking Order materialised on the screen [SNAPSHOT 5].\n\n\"Here is our order of battle. The strikers are Hammers and Irons, led by myself and Moonshadows skipper. Sweeps - led by CAG - will clear the way of enemy fighters. Zaps - two Spartan jets - are going to take care of enemy air defences on our way, we'll get back to that in a while. Finally, Trons - again Moonshadows - are equipped with jamming pods to suppress enemy SAMs while we're in the target area. \n\nVerify your jet locations with the deck crews. We will crank at 22:00 and check the comms one minute later, make sure you have your radios running. Follow the yellow shirts as always, though the rough takeoff order should be: Sweeps, Irons, Zaps, Tron, and Hammers last.\"\n\nCajun signaled Dutch to change the image on the screen [SNAPSHOT 6].\n\n\"We'll meet up at our marshall area at waypoint one, each aircraft will get there separately. Use radars and SA page to locate your flight lead, with stack altitudes on the screen as a reference.  Sweeps will push at 2219 and 30s, rest of the package at 2220. Use the time to verify your weapons and aim points, set up your NVGs, but keep your heads on a swivel - a midair is the last thing we need. As to formation - we will fly a standard finger four.\"\n\nHe looked at Flip, and then  gestured to Dutch for the next slide [SNAPSHOT 7].\n\n\"We will change course as we leave Omani airspace. It will be up to Zaps to destroy the SA-15 launcher on Larak while the rest of the package continues north. Trons, Zaps, and Sweeps will anchor south from the target, while we move up and roll in.Hammers will drop on the wharf where IRGC keeps most of their boghammars and dhows. Irons will attack the secondary site used by the Iranians. After release we will egress southeast. Provided enemy didn't set any surprises, Tron's jammers should be able to degrade all SAM systems enough to make locking us up extremely difficult. Still, remember to set up your countermeasures and call out any launches you see.\"\n\nAs Dutch changed the slide to the next, a satellite image of the harbor appeared [SNAPSHOT 8].\n\n\"This is the main target, with aimpoints for each Hammer marked. The A's scattered around are main AAA sites. We can expect some stiff resistance, so we'll stay at angels 15 for our delivery. Irons will do the same\".\n\nNext photo appeared, showing a similar target area for the second group of strikers. Cajun then showed a series of recon photos for each aim point, until he got to Flip's [SNAPSHOT 9]. \n\n\"Flip, your targets are next to one another. Both piers are used to moor boghammars, while the yachts and catamaran you see belong to high ranking officers in IRGC - . You can call it psychological warfare if you will, but they surely will feel the loss of THESE ships profoundly\".\n\nSome of the people gathered in the room chuckled at that remark.\n\n\"Each Hammer and Iron will get four separate aim points. Set them in PP mode for your GBUs and then double - no, triple check that they are correct. We want to hit exactly those 32 points. Also, before rolling in, put your FLIR on targets and verify that you have exactly that view in sight, plus or minus some boghammars. Intel says that no civilian vessels - and by that I mean others than belonging to IRGC brass - are allowed to moor in these spots. Any questions up to this point?\"\n\nThere were none. Satisfied, Skipper continued.\n\n\"Comms. We'll stay on Strike on Pri and our respective flight frequencies on Aux. We'll have Knight monitoring both. There are two tankers: Texaco for Hammers and Irons and Shell for the others, contact them on the way back using Departure. \n\nWe will have enough fuel to hit the targets and then get to the boat, plus a reserve in case something unexpected happens. If you need to, get a drink on the way back before landing. In case of trouble, Furaijah in Oman will be our divert tonight. Omani authorities allowed us to use their airspace while passing north and on the way back\".\n\nHe then spent another 40 minutes talking about contingencies: dozens of them from unexpected weather conditions to communication backups, from search and rescue procedures for a down plane to go/no-go criteria. After answering a few questions, Cajun offered CAG a chance to address the group. CAG Swoboda stood and turned to the group.\n\n\"Skipper, good brief, thanks. Ladies and gentlemen, Bandar Abbas is the first of several heavily defended targets we're going to hit tonight along the Iranian coast, and because it's the Pasdaran HQ, we want to ensure we hit hard and with precision. Any element of surprise will be expended on this strike. We've got a smart suppression plan with exposed DMPIs and standoff precision weapons. In your element brief, talk contingencies: your backup delivery, comm degrades, the jamming plan if you get a pop-up emitter you didn't expect. We have to do some serious damage on this strike because the others build on it. So, continue to brief it in detail, fly the brief, and use those blocking and tackling skills we've practiced all cruise. Fly solid formations, know and use the code words, do combat checklists early and double check 'em. And study the targets and how you'll use funneling features to find them. If they send up fighters, shoot them down. But if you accept a commit, know what you are flying over. Be aggressive and be smart. That's all I've got. See you out there.\" \n\nThe room jumped to attention as CAG walked down the aisle to the door. \"Carry On,\" he said as he left, his Ops Officer \"Bucket\" following him out. The room then broke up into groups. Some talked in a corner and others left for other ready rooms where they would go over their formation tasking in detail in their element briefs. A few flight leads sought Cajun to clarify a point. Within five minutes only the Hammer and Iron formations remained. \n\nFlip switched to ATO page on his kneeboard and notes down SA page abbreviations for each flight, figuring it would help during a rejoin in the pitch black [SNAPSHOT 10]. \n\nWilson looked at his watch. Ten minutes to walk time. He went up to the duty desk and was the first to pick up a personal sidearm, a clip, and a \"blood-chit\" guarantee from the United States Government. Written in dozens of languages, it offered a reward if this pilot--Wilson--was returned safely to friendly forces. He also signed for a pair of night vision goggles..\n\n---------- DESIGNER'S NOTES ----------\n\n1. Set up your weapons in PP mode while still on deck and request taxi when done, then wait for the director to move you. \n\n2. During ingress and attack, make sure to stay where your flight expects you to be - on his RIGHT wing." : "间谍汇报完毕后，卡真继续任务简报，随后一小时里带领飞行员们逐步梳理任务细节。随着按钮按下，空中任务指令显现在屏幕上[快照5]。\n\n\"这是我们的作战序列。负责打击的是Hammer和IRON小队，分别由我和Moonshadows中队指挥官带队。SWEEP组——由联队长指挥——负责清理敌方战机。压制组——两架Spartan战机——将清除途中的敌方防空系统，稍后会详细说明。最后干扰组——同样来自Moonshadows中队——配备干扰吊舱，在目标区域压制敌防空导弹。\n\n向甲板人员确认战机位置。22:00启动引擎，一分钟后检查通讯，确保无线电畅通。按惯例跟随黄衫员引导，大致起飞顺序为：SWEEP组、IRON、压制组、干扰组，Hammer组最后起飞。\"\n\n卡真示意DUTCH切换屏幕图像[快照6]。\n\n\"我们将在1号航路点集结点汇合，各机独立抵达。参照屏幕标注的编队高度，使用雷达和SA页面定位长机。SWEEP组将于22:19:30推进，其余编队22:20出发。利用时间检查武器与瞄准点，调试夜视镜，但保持警惕——空中相撞是我们最不愿看到的。编队采用标准四指阵型。\"\n\n他看向FLIP，示意切换下一张幻灯片[快照7]。\n\n\"离开阿曼领空后将改变航向。压制组负责摧毁拉拉克岛的SA-15发射车，其余编队继续北进。干扰组、压制组与SWEEP组将在目标以南待命，我们则前突展开攻击。Hammer组轰炸码头区——伊斯兰革命卫队快艇和独桅帆船主要停泊处。IRON组攻击伊朗人使用的次要设施。投弹后向东南撤退。只要敌人没有埋伏，干扰组的电子压制足以让所有防空系统难以锁定。但仍需设置对抗措施，发现导弹发射立即通报。\"\n\n卫星港区图像呈现时[快照8]：\n\"这是主要目标，标注了各Hammer组的瞄准点。散落的A标记是高炮阵地。预计遭遇顽强抵抗，投弹高度保持15,000英尺。IRON组同理。\"\n\n第二组打击目标的图像出现后，卡真逐一展示各瞄准点的侦察照片，直到FLIP负责的区域[快照9]：\n\"FLIP，你的两个目标相邻。这两座码头停泊着快艇，游艇和双体船属于革命卫队高层——不妨称之为心理战，他们绝对会痛心疾首。\"\n\n简报室响起零星笑声。\n\n\"每架Hammer和IRON战机分配四个瞄准点。为GBU设置PP模式后必须反复确认坐标。我们要精准命中这32个点位。滚转投弹前用前视红外确认目标，画面应与情报完全一致——除了可能增减的快艇。情报显示这些泊位严禁民用船只停靠。目前有问题吗？\"\n\n无人提问。中队长满意地继续：\n\"通讯主频用STRIKE频道，辅频用各编队频道。KNIGHT负责监听两者。两架加油机：Hammer和IRON使用Texaco，其余用Shell，返航时通过离场频道联系。\n\n燃油足够支撑攻击后返航，另有应急储备。必要时返程可进行空中加油。遇险时阿曼的富莱迦机场是今晚备降场。阿曼当局已允许我们过境北上及返航。\"\n\n他花40分钟讲解应急预案：从突发天气到备用通讯，从坠机搜救到行动中止标准。答疑结束后，卡真请联队长讲话。斯沃博达联队长起身面向众人：\n\n\"中队长，简报很完善。各位，阿巴斯港是今晚伊朗海岸系列重防目标的首个打击点。作为革命卫队司令部所在地，我们必须实施精准重击。本次突袭将耗尽所有突然性优势。我们制定了智能压制计划，标明了重点打击坐标并配备防区外精确武器。分队简报时要细化应急预案：备用攻击方案、通讯降级处置、突发辐射源干扰计划。首战必须重创敌军，后续行动都基于此。所以务必详细规划，严格执行，运用整个巡航期间锤炼的战术素养。保持严密编队，熟记暗语，提前完成战斗检查单并复核。研究目标特征及定位方法。若遇敌机，果断击落。但接战前务必明确所处空域。既要凶猛，更要明智。完毕。\"\n\n联队长离席时全员肃立。\"继续。\"他带着绰号\"水桶\"的作战科长离去后，简报室分组讨论起来。部分人聚在角落交谈，其他人前往各待命室开展分队简报。几位长机找卡真确认细节。五分钟后仅剩Hammer与IRON成员。\n\nFLIP在膝板调出任务指令，记录各编队SA页面缩写，想着漆黑中重新编队时能派上用场[快照10]。\n\n威尔逊看表：离出发还有十分钟。他率先到值班台领取手枪、弹匣和美国政府签发的\"血契\"。这份多语言文件承诺将安全归还飞行员——即威尔逊——者予以重赏。签收夜视镜时，他再次核对清单。\n\n---------- 设计者说明 ----------\n\n1. 甲板待命时即设置PP模式武器，完成后申请滑行，等待引导员指挥。\n\n2. 进入与攻击阶段务必保持编队位置——位于长机右翼。",

  "15/03/2008, 19:00\nUSS Valley Forge\nReady Room 7\n\nReady Seven was standing room only as the aircrew assigned to strike package 1A met to brief. The aviators, most from other air wing squadrons, studied a stapled \"kneeboard package\" of briefing cards that contained the aircraft lineup, frequency plan, navigation plan, drawings of target area tactics, and aimpoint photos. Some talked among themselves as they sat in the high-backed chairs. Others clicked open their ballpoint pens to write notes in the margins. Cajun stood at the front of the room with a projector screen behind him. He looked at the clock: one minute to go. \"A'tenshun on deck!\" one of the lieutenants sang out, and all rose as CAG Swoboda entered from the back. \"Seats,\" said CAG as he strode to the front of the ready room, nodded a greeting to Cajun, and took his seat in the front row next to Wilson. Cajun handed Swoboda a kneeboard package and asked the room if anyone else needed one. With 20 seconds to go, he reminded all to synchronize watches with the SINS clock. At 1900, six bells sounded over the 1MC, and Cajun began: \"CAG, welcome to strike 1A, a strike designed to degrade and attrite the IRGC maritime forces in support of national tasking. We've got two groups of strikers--accompanied by dedicated sweep, defense suppression, and jamming packages--going into Bandar Abbas. Launch time is 2200. We will push out along this route, with my flight, Hammer one-one, in the lead.\" As Cajun spoke, Dutch advanced slides on the projector. The \"snapshots\" of key events during the strike gave the aircrew a sense of the plan [SNAPSHOT 3]\n\nAfter the overview, Cajun turned the brief over to the Aerographer's Mate from the ship's meteorology office for the weather forecast. The clear weather Wilson had seen from the hangar bay was to hold, with probable low-scattered clouds in the vicinity of Hormuz, and a partial moon rising just before recovery time. \n\nNext, the Intel officer - the spy - gave the rundown on the Iranian order of battle and air defenses.\n\nLTJG McHardy stepped forward and smiled at the assembled crowd. Dutch displayed a new image behind her back [SNAPSHOT 4].\n\n\"Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Strike 1A is going against the well defended target, although it seems that Iranian SAMs are positioned mainly around the Havadarya airfield and not directly next to the wharf, which is protected by AAA of various calibers. As you can see here\" - she pointed at the target area, marked with several red circles - \"you can expect newer SA-15 launchers, together with an older SA-6 site and short range Roland in the vicinity of the primary. There also is one other SA-15 at Lirak, guarding access to Bandar Abbas.\n\nWhen it comes to fighters, the enemy is keeping a light presence near the coast, usually one pair of Phantoms or Tigers. The Tomcats are stationed in Shiraz, and Fulcrums are at Bushier. It is likely they will get scrambled but won't arrive on station before the strike package deliver their ordnance. We were unable to locate the MiG-35\" - McHardy looked at Flip." : "2008年3月15日 19:00\n\"福吉谷号\"航空母舰\n7号简报室\n\n简报室内座无虚席，参与1A打击编队的机组人员正在集结待命。这些大多来自其他飞行中队的飞行员们仔细研读着钉装的\"膝板简报包\"，里面包含战机序列、频率计划、导航方案、目标区域战术示意图以及瞄准点照片。有人坐在高背椅上低声交谈，也有人\"咔嗒\"按开圆珠笔在资料边缘做着笔记。卡真站在房间前端，身后是投影屏幕。他看了眼时钟：还剩一分钟。\"全体注意！\"一名中尉高声喊道，所有人起立迎接从后方入场的联队长斯沃博达。\"就座。\"联队长边说边大步走向简报室前端，向卡真点头致意后坐在前排威尔逊身旁。卡真递给斯沃博达一份膝板简报包，并询问在场人员是否还需要补充。最后20秒，他提醒所有人与舰船惯性导航系统时钟对表。19:00整，舰内广播系统传来六响钟声，卡真开始简报：\"联队长，欢迎参加1A打击行动，本次行动旨在削弱伊朗革命卫队海上力量以支持国家任务。我们将派出两组攻击机群——配备专用SWEEP、防御压制和电子干扰编队——突袭阿巴斯港。起飞时间为22:00。我们将沿此航线推进，由我的锤击1-1小队领航。\"卡真讲解时，达奇操作着投影仪切换幻灯片。[关键节点示意图3]呈现的打击行动关键节点让机组对计划有了整体把握。\n\n概述结束后，卡真将简报交由舰载气象部门的气象士官进行天气预报。威尔逊在机库甲板看到的晴朗天气将持续，霍尔木兹海峡附近可能出现低散云层，回收时段前将升起弦月。\n\n接着情报官——那位情报专员——详细介绍了伊朗的战斗序列与防空部署。\n\n麦克哈迪中尉上前一步，对集结的机组人员报以微笑。达奇在她身后切换出新的图像[关键节点示意图4]。\n\n\"晚上好各位。1A打击行动将针对防御完善的目标区展开，不过伊朗防空导弹主要部署在哈瓦达利亚机场周边，码头区域主要由不同口径的高射炮防护。如各位所见\"——她指向标注着数个红圈的目标区域——\"预计会遇到新型道尔-M1防空系统，配合目标区周边的老式萨姆-6和中程罗兰特系统。在通往阿巴斯港的利拉克方向还部署有另一套道尔系统。\n\n战斗机方面，敌人在海岸线附近仅维持少量存在，通常是一对F-4Phantom或虎式战机。雄猫驻扎在设拉子，支点则在布什尔。虽然他们可能紧急起飞，但在STRIKE编队投弹前应该来不及抵达战位。我们尚未定位到米格-35的踪迹\"——麦克哈迪看向FLIP。",

  "Sunday, 16 March 2008\nUSS Valley Forge\nReady Room 7\n\nExactly at 1600 the CCTV screen came to life, showing Lieutenant JG McHardy. Flip glanced at Saint, sitting next to him, his pen ready over the kneeboard, face showing no emotion except perhaps hardly concealed disdain. Wilson wondered why Cmdr Patrick would volunteer to lead this particular mission - especially given that it was an ad hoc assignment based on satellite imagery from 1400. Saint was the last person on board Valley Forge willing to forgo carefully prepared plans and take part in a hastily devised operation, let alone lead it. Unless - as acting commanding officer - he really had no choice but to do it. Being in charge of a squadron quite often meant more responsibilities - and having to lead by example.\n\n\"Good afternoon Tomahawk, I am Lieutenant JG Helen McHardy and this is event three brief. CSG-4 is in the Gulf of Oman and continues launching strikes aimed at degrading Iranian naval capabilities and reducing threats to freedom of navigation in the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nThe weather today is good, with clear skies, visibility greater than 10 miles, and 21 degrees Celsius. The seas are calm, the wind speed is 8 knots blowing from the south. \n\nCASE I launch is planned for 1815, with a CASE III recovery scheduled for 1930. All the details, as always, can be found in the Card of the Day which should have already been distributed. \n\nCarrier's position at launch will be N25 35, E56 52. Valley Forge is making 14 knots and will continue on her current heading until recovery at the following coordinates: N25 16, E56 54. \n\nDivert airfield for this mission is Fujairah International in Oman, all relevant information and charts are included in the kneeboard packages. \n\nAs usual, stay clear of the airspace of Gulf Cooperation Council Countries, with an exception of the northeastern territory of Oman, which the strike group will traverse in order to stay away from an Iranian Hawk battery position on the coastline near Sirik.\n\nThree squadrons will be participating in this event: four Raven aircraft will carry out the main strike, with two Moonshadows tasked with SEAD/DEAD and one Sea Owl for electronic warfare. 4 Harriers from VMA-231 launched from Tinian and will be operating between Bandar-e-Jask and Bazreh on the eastern shore of the Gulf of Oman.\n\nThe task for this mission is a strike against an Iranian submarine maintenance facility and possibly one submarine in Bandar Abbas. Our reconnaissance flights earlier today detected one Kilo-class vessel moored in the open near the wharf in the area attacked yesterday by Strike 1 Alpha. We believe that the sub may have suffered some damage and could still be out in the open or in the nearby pen.\"\n\nA photo of the target area appeared on the screen (snapshot 2).\n\nAll the aviators gathered in the room - except for Saint, who was scribbling something in his notepad - exchanged surprised looks. Iranians either didn't believe that another attack against Bandar Abbas could take place so soon after the previous one, or their submarine indeed was badly damaged and for some reason, they needed to keep her in the open. Either way, that indeed was a very juicy target. Lieutenant JG McHardy continued.\n\n\"As the area is defended by additional assets, including several SA-6 batteries, the plan for the attack is to use the standoff weapons, namely JSOWs, which will keep the package outside the SAM envelope. Any threats on the way to the target will be suppressed by the Moonshadows and jamming. \n\nThere were indications that Iranians are planning to, and may have already deployed Silkworm missiles which could harass commercial shipping in almost all of Gulf of Oman and the entire Strait of Hormuz. These are a valid secondary target for this mission. \n\nROE is as follows: you are cleared to engage the main target in Bandar Abbas, namely the sub facility and any submarines that are spotted. You are also free to attack any SAM sites threatening the package, as well as Iranian fighters jets that are pursuing or flying towards the strikers and show hostile intentions. The Silkworm batteries mentioned earlier are also valid targets.\n\nThat is all from my side. Have a safe flight, and we'll see you back in CVIC for the debrief.\"\n\nMcHardy's face disappeared from the screen, replaced by familiar rows of letters and numbers indicating the current position of the ship and weather conditions (snapshot 3)." : "2008年3月16日 星期日\n\"福吉谷\"号航母\n第七待命室\n\n16:00整，闭路电视屏幕亮起，显示出海军中尉麦克哈迪的身影。FLIP瞥了眼身旁的SAINT——他正将钢笔悬停在膝板记事本上方，脸上除了几近掩饰不住的轻蔑外毫无表情。威尔逊不明白帕特里克中校为何主动请缨带队执行这次特殊任务，尤其是考虑到这仅是根据14时卫星图像临时下达的任务。作为\"福吉谷\"号上最不愿放弃周密计划参与仓促行动的人，SAINT本该是最后可能接手的人选，更遑论带队执行。除非——作为代理指挥官——他确实别无选择。掌管一个中队往往意味着更多责任，以及必须以身作则。\n\n\"下午好战斧中队，我是海军中尉海伦·麦克哈迪，现在进行第三次任务简报。第四航母打击现位于阿曼湾，持续发动打击以削弱伊朗海军战力，降低霍尔木兹海峡航行自由面临的威胁。\n\n今日天气良好，晴空，能见度超10英里，气温21摄氏度。海况平静，南风8节。\n\n计划1815时实施CASE I起飞，1930时进行CASE III回收。所有细节照例可在已下发的当日任务卡中查阅。\n\n起飞时航母位置北纬25度35分，东经56度52分。\"福吉谷\"号航速14节，将保持当前航向直至回收坐标：北纬25度16分，东经56度54分。\n\n本次任务备降机场为阿曼富查伊拉国际机场，所有相关信息和航图已包含在膝板资料包中。\n\n照例避开海湾合作委员会国家空域，但允许穿越阿曼东北部领空以规避锡里克海岸附近的伊朗霍克导弹阵地。\n\n本次任务有三个中队参与：四架Raven战机执行主攻，两架Moonshadows负责SEAD/DEAD，一架海猫头鹰实施电子战。从提尼安岛起飞的VMA-231中队四架鹞式战机将在阿曼湾东岸贾斯克港至巴兹雷赫之间活动。\n\n任务目标是打击伊朗潜艇维修设施及可能停泊在阿巴斯港的一艘潜艇。今日早间侦察发现一艘基洛级潜艇停泊在昨日'打击1A'攻击区域的码头附近露天水域。我们认为该潜艇可能已受损，目前仍露天停放或停靠附近干船坞。\"\n\n目标区域照片出现在屏幕上（快照2）。\n\n除了在记事本上涂写的SAINT，舱内所有飞行员都交换了惊讶的眼神。伊朗人要么不相信阿巴斯港会在前次袭击后这么快再遭打击，要么他们的潜艇确实严重受损且因故必须露天停放。无论如何，这确实是个诱人目标。麦克哈迪中尉继续道：\n\n\"鉴于该区域新增了若干萨姆6导弹营等防御力量，攻击计划使用防区外武器——即联合防区外武器（JSOW），使编队保持在防空导弹射程外。途中所有威胁将由Moonshadows中队和电子干扰压制。\n\n有迹象表明伊朗可能已部署蚕式导弹，可袭扰阿曼湾大部及整个霍尔木兹海峡的商业航运。这些是本次任务的次要合法目标。\n\n交战规则如下：授权攻击阿巴斯港主要目标，即潜艇设施及任何被发现的潜艇。允许攻击威胁编队的防空阵地，以及表现出敌意并追击/逼近攻击编队的伊朗战机。前述蚕式导弹阵地也属合法目标。\n\n我这边简报完毕。祝飞行顺利，我们将在航母情报中心等待各位归来进行任务汇报。\"\n\n麦克哈迪的面容从屏幕上消失，取而代之的是熟悉的字母数字阵列，显示着舰船当前位置和天气状况（快照3）。",

  "Saint stood up in front of the group. \n\n\"All right everyone. We are getting new tasks from above, but this is an opportunity we cannot miss: a Kilo-class submarine moored in Bandar Abbas next to what appears to be a sub repair and maintenance facility. We will be attacking during the evening, which adds to the risk factor, however, we may surprise the Iranians with striking in the same spot twice in a row.\"\n\nOthers exchanged unconvinced looks once again. \n\n\"We all know what happened yesterday. Faced with the malfunction of GPS - guided bombs, Skipper took a decision there and then to perform a manual delivery on a heavily defended target. In this act of bravery, he lost his life, while other jets took some damage. Now, as acting commanding officer of the Ravens, it is my duty to see to it that there will be no more losses and no more unnecessary risks. This time we will use stand-off weapons without the necessity of going over Bandar Abbas and AAA positions. Even if they are spoofed, it won't put us in danger.\"\n\nHe nodded at Sponge Bob, who sat at the duty officer desk, and the briefing page appeared on the screen behind him (snapshot 4).\n\n\"OK, let's start with the basics. We will go as Raven 31 flight, here are the assigned aircraft. 403 and 412 are parked on elevator 3, 402 and 411 are on elevator 4. Shadow 41 is on elevator 1 and Deathstar - our EW support - in the Corral. We will walk at 17:45 and crank around 18:10, takeoff order: Texaco and Deathstar, then Shadows, finally Ravens. we will join upon mother's 340, at 25 miles, and then push towards our target. \n\nHe gestured to Sponge Bob again and a new image appeared on the screen (snapshot 5).\n\n\"We will avoid most of the threats by closely following our flight plan, suppress the SA-6 at Hormuz island using HARMs, and then deliver all eight AGM-154s at maximum range without the need to get too close to our target. Suppression is Shadow 41's task, who is going to destroy or force the sites on Hormuz and in Bandar Abbas to shut down, providing us with a window of opportunity to perform our attack. We will egress using the same route as ingress. Let's have a closer look at the threats\" (Snapshot 6). \n\n\"As you can see, the Iranians have installed additional SAM systems in the area, fortunately, most of these are older, one digit types which should be easily jammed by Darkstar. If we execute everything properly, we won't even come close to an SA-15's attack envelope. Now, on to the aim points.\" \n\nSaint nodded at Sponge, who loaded next screen (Snapshot 7).\n\nThe exact aim points are in your kneeboards. I will engage the repair facility, Mr. Fagan the submarine and the western workshop, Mr. Wilson, any remaining workshops, and Mr. Nguyen the Kilo.\n\nWeapons. Set up your aim points still on deck, double-check all the digits, and set them up in pre-planned mode. We will arm our weapons during the fence in. Let me make it clear: I want no mistakes, people. All the weapons need to hit their intended targets. Is that clear?\"\n\nNods from everyone. Sponge changed the images behind, showing an additional recon photo of the target (snapshot 8).\n\n\"Comms. We will stay on CH1 on Aux as our tactical frequency. After take-off, we will switch to Strike - or CH2 - on Pri. Keep the chatter on the radios to a minimum on the ingress and egress. \n\nAs you all have heard, the weather is good with great or unlimited visibility and no clouds, the seas are calm. Any questions?\"\n\nFlip raised his hand.\n\n\"Mr. Wilson?\"\n\n\"XO, we have no dedicated sweep package, so I understand this will be a self-escort mission. Any contingencies if we encounter enemy fighters?\" \n\n\"Indeed. If threatened, it will be your element's task, Mr. Wilson, to engage and chase them away. You will then return on the flight path and attack the primary as fragged.

  "Ready Room 7\nUSS Valley Forge\n03:10\n\nFlip met with Blade, Clam and Olive for their briefing, after which all of them would go to preflight their jets. First pair will then climb inside the cockpits for the next 3 hours, while others would hang around the Ready Room. \n\n\"OK, I assume you know the general situation. Our intel guys intercepted Iranian comms about an imminent attack against an important target in the Persian Gulf - very likely the Saleh natural gas field, belonging to UAE.\n\nI will sit on Alert 7 together with Blade in 403 and 406, both jets are parked on the Street. Clam and Olive, you have 405 and 410 on elevator 2 when you relieve us.\n\nBlade, if we're launched, rendezvous with me on the initial vector given to us by Strike or the Air Boss. Once we have our anchor point assigned, we'll hold at angels 20 unless told otherwise. \n\nOur primary mission will be to defend Saleh Field or any other location from enemy attack. We will work closely with Knight and Strike on this one\".\n\nHe turned to the map, which also had enemy SAM locations marked (snapshot 3).\n\n\"We will likely operate off the western coast of Oman and UAE. If the Iranians do launch, it will be from Shiraz or Bushier, which will give us enough time to prepare. Unless - although we have no imagery to prove it -  Iranian fighters are on strip alert at austere forward alert strips in the Hormuz area,which also is a possibility . Moreover, the UAE Air Force has a pair of M-2000s on standby, ready to launch from Al Dhafra and get on station within 15-20 minutes. Their anchor point will be south from Saleh\" - Flip pointed at the likely area with his finger.\n\n\"Remember: if we go, our main task is to protect Saleh, any other oil and gas fields or potential targets. This means strikers should be our main priority. Having said that, if the Iranians are aggressive, we can and will respond in kind.\"\n\n\"Weapons. We will be carrying 6 Amraams and 2 Sidewinders plus two tanks each. Iranians don't have comparable missiles in their inventory - unless they still possess some of the Phoenixes left for their Tomcats. We will have an undeniable advantage in BVR. So, if Iranian jets are declared hostile and come in numbers, we will both launch at long range. Perhaps this will be enough to discourage them. Make no mistake, the Iranian Air Force had one of the largest numbers of aces credited with more than 6 kills, and some of them are still serving as generals. During their long war with Iraq they developed advanced and effective fighting strategies. Even though 20 years has passed, there is a high chance their pilots will know their jets and their trade, so be careful. Also, if the UAE's fighters join, double check your targets before firing. \n\nComms - as usual, covered in the card of the day. We'll stay on tactical on Aux and switch to Knight on Pri as soon as we take off. \n\nWeather - moderate winds and scattered clouds, not likely to change within the next half day or so. \n\nNavigation. Not much to say here - if we launch, we will get our initial vector, and then Knight will send us where we'll be most useful. Rock is designated as waypoint 1 positioned here\n\nEmergencies. UAE SAR assets are positioned along the coast, there are also helicopters likely to be stationed on the platforms in Saleh field. We will be close to Mother, so set joker to 5 000 and tank to 3 000. \n\nROE - we are free to engage targets that shoot first at any of our or our allied assets, plus anything which is declared hostile by Knight or Strike. In the latter case we are NOT required to obtain visual ID before engaging. \n\nFinally, divert airfield, if absolutely necessary, is Fujairah on the east coast of the UAE. OK, I think that is all. Anything for me? No? Let's do it.\"\n\nDESIGNERS NOTES:\n\n1. you can check the radios at any time, your wingman will start taxiing only after you do.\n\n2. taxi to the assigned CAT and wait for Blade to get on his before launching." : "准备室7\n\"福吉谷\"号航母\n03:10\n\nFlip与Blade、Clam和Olive进行了任务简报，之后他们将各自去进行战机起飞前准备。第一组飞行员将进入驾驶舱待命3小时，其他人则在准备室候命。\n\n\"好的，我想你们都了解基本情况。我们的情报人员截获了伊朗方面即将对波斯湾重要目标发动攻击的通讯——很可能是针对阿联酋的Saleh天然气田。\n\n我将与Blade驾驶403和406号机在'街道'区域保持7号戒备状态。Clam和Olive，你们在接替我们时使用2号升降机上的405和410号机。\n\nBlade，如果我们紧急起飞，按Strike或空中指挥官给出的初始航向与我汇合。获得锚点位置后，我们将在20000英尺高度待命，除非另有指示。\n\n主要任务是保卫Saleh气田或其他可能遭受攻击的目标。这次行动我们将与Knight和Strike密切配合。\"\n\n他转向标注了敌方防空导弹位置的地图（快照3）。\n\n\"我们很可能在阿曼和阿联酋西海岸附近活动。如果伊朗发动攻击，应该会从设拉子或布什尔起飞，这能给我们足够的准备时间。不过——虽然目前没有图像证据——伊朗战机也可能部署在霍尔木兹地区的简易前线警戒机场，这种可能性也存在。此外，阿联酋空军有两架M-2000战机待命，可从Al Dhafra基地在15-20分钟内赶到战位。他们的锚点将在Saleh以南。\"Flip用手指指出了可能区域。\n\n\"记住：如果出动，首要任务是保护Saleh及其他油气田或潜在目标。这意味着攻击机群应是我们优先拦截目标。话虽如此，如果伊朗方面表现敌意，我们也将予以对等回应。\n\n武器配置：每人携带6枚Amraam和2枚Sidewinder导弹，外加两个副油箱。伊朗没有同等水平的导弹——除非他们的雄猫战机还装备着剩余的Phoenix导弹。我们在超视距作战中具有绝对优势。所以如果确认伊朗战机为敌对目标且数量众多，我们将在远距离开火。也许这就能让他们知难而退。别大意，伊朗空军曾拥有击落6架以上敌机的王牌飞行员数量位居世界前列，其中一些人至今仍在担任将军职务。在与伊拉克的长期战争中，他们发展出了先进有效的战术策略。尽管过去了20年，他们的飞行员很可能仍精通战机性能与空战技巧，务必小心。另外如果阿联酋战机加入，开火前务必二次确认目标。\n\n通讯——按日常规程执行，使用当日密码卡。起飞后主频切换至Knight，备用频保持战术通讯。\n\n天气——中等风力，疏云，未来半天内不太可能变化。\n\n导航——没太多要说的。如果起飞，先按初始航向飞行，之后Knight会指引我们前往最需要的位置。Rock设为1号航路点，位置在这里。\n\n紧急情况——阿联酋搜救力量沿海岸部署，Saleh气田平台也可能驻有直升机。我们距离母舰很近，所以将joker油量设为5000磅，加油临界值设为3000磅。\n\n交战规则——我们可以自由攻击任何首先向我方或盟军单位开火的目标，以及被Knight或Strike判定为敌对的目标。后者情况下不需要目视识别即可交战。\n\n最后，如绝对必要，备降机场是阿联酋东海岸的富查伊拉。好了，我想就这些。有什么问题？没有？开始行动。\"\n\n设计说明：\n1. 可随时检查无线电，僚机将在你之后开始滑行\n2. 滑行至指定弹射位，等待Blade就位后再起飞",

  "Cockpit of 403\nUSS Valley Forge, Gulf of Oman\n06:10 am\n\nWilson flipped the page in his book and adjusted his flashlight. Outside the dawn was finally breaking out, but it was still too dark to read without artificial light. He tried to stretch as he checked his watch - 10 minutes ago they started their third and final hour of Alert-7 duty. Flip glanced to his left at Blade, who seemed to be napping in his ejection seat, when he noticed an unusual commotion near the Island and on the flight deck, as catapult crews started pouring out through the hatches, running towards their assigned positions. He also saw airman Rodriguez, his plane captain, approaching him and making urgent hand signals to start up. Soon after, the loudspeakers boomed with the voice of the Air Boss:\n\n\"Now launch the Alert-7 Hornets! Now launch the Alert-7 Hornets!\"\n\nUSS Valley Forge, CVIC\n12 hours earlier\n\n\"Gentlemen, welcome to this situation intel brief\" - DCAG Allen nodded at the squadron COs and XOs, as well as Saint and Flip representing the Ravens - \"our strikes in the last two days have considerably degraded Iranian Navy's ability to harass tankers and other shipping passing through Strait of Hormuz. So far Tehran has made no attempt to retaliate in kind, at least not against our forces. However, earlier today Iranian missiles hit one of the UAE's oil drilling platforms in the Gulf, while Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commandos boarded and kidnapped two vessels owned by UAE companies. Needless to say, this made our allies nervous, but more willing to cooperate. We are currently preparing new sorties, including one major strike but we have also acquired some interesting intel on the Iranian's plans. Commander Higgins has more details and will share them with you.\" \n\nDCAG nodded at the Air Wing Intel Officer, who immediately took over.\n\n\"Thank you, sir. Indeed, we intercepted communications at the highest echelons of Iranian military about an imminent retaliatory strike against our Allies in the Persian Gulf. We drew up a list of possible targets and the most likely ones are Saleh Gas field, situated 28 miles North West of Ras Al Khaimah, here.\n\nIt is closer to Iranian SAMs, which could provide cover for attacking aircraft and is further away from UAE air bases, mainly Al Dhafra. We already saw a steady increase in activity in and around Shiraz and if the attacks are going to take place, we are expecting it to happen within the next 24 hours\". \n\nShag, the bald, broad shouldered CO of Moonshadows, rose his hand.\n\n\"Colonel?\"\n\n\"If the strike occurs, what types of airplanes can we expect?\"\n\n\"Iranians have only one dedicated attack jet in their inventory with the legs to reach the target area, the Su-24. However, they may choose to send the Phantoms or even a large group of Tigers, escorted by the Tomcats or Fulcrums. We have seen all these aircraft flying sorties in recent days, although none of these were directed against ours or our allies assets. The only airframe unaccounted for so far is the MiG-35\". \n\nDCAG stood up again.\n\n\"Thank you, Commander\" - he turned to the pilots - \"having all that in mind, CAG decided to keep a pair of Hornets on Alert-7 and another one on Alert-30 at all times\" - he ignored a murmur that went through the room, although he expected it. Sitting in full gear in the jet parked on the deck in Persian Gulf - even in the spring - was hardly the tasking any pilot would be looking forward to.\n\n\"We will be doing 3 hour shifts, rotating squadrons every 6 hours. I want the COs to provide me with the schedules for the next 24 hours, starting from 1 am. Any questions? Good. Go and brief your squadrons.\"" : "403号机驾驶舱\nUSS Valley Forge号 阿曼湾\n上午06:10\n\n威尔逊翻动书页，调整着头灯。舷窗外曙光初现，但光线仍不足以进行自然光阅读。他伸了个懒腰查看手表——十分钟前他们进入了警戒7任务的第三个小时，也是最后一小时。FLIP转头看向左侧的布莱德，对方似乎正在弹射座椅上打盹，这时他注意到舰岛和飞行甲板上出现了异常骚动，弹射组员正从舱门涌出奔向各自战位。他还看到他的机工长罗德里格兹正快步走来，打着急促的手势要求启动引擎。紧接着，广播里传来航空长的吼声：\n\n\"立即弹射警戒7大黄蜂！立即弹射警戒7大黄蜂！\"\n\nUSS Valley Forge号 航母情报中心\n12小时前\n\n\"先生们，欢迎参加本次敌情简报\"——副联队长艾伦向各中队指挥官及其副手点头致意，也包括代表Raven中队的SAINT和FLIP——\"过去两天的打击行动已显著削弱伊朗海军骚扰霍尔木兹海峡油轮及其他商船的能力。截至目前，德黑兰尚未采取对等报复，至少未针对我军。但今日早些时候，伊朗导弹击中了波斯湾一处阿联酋石油钻井平台，同时伊斯兰革命卫队突击队劫持了两艘阿联酋公司货轮。这显然令我们的盟友感到紧张，但也提升了合作意愿。我们正在准备新的出击任务，包括一次大规模打击，同时获得了关于伊朗行动计划的重要情报。希金斯中校将进行详细说明。\"\n\n副联队长向联队情报官点头示意，后者立即接过话头。\n\n\"谢谢长官。我们确实截获了伊朗军方高层关于即将对波斯湾盟军实施报复性打击的通信。经目标分析研判，最可能袭击的是位于拉斯海马西北28英里的萨勒赫气田，位置在这里。\n\n该区域更靠近伊朗防空导弹掩护范围，且远离阿联酋主要空军基地——阿尔达夫拉。我们已观察到设拉子周边活动频率持续上升，若袭击发生，预计将在未来24小时内。\" \n\n光头宽肩的Moonshadows中队指挥官沙格举手提问。\n\n\"上校？\"\n\n\"如果袭击发生，预计会遭遇哪些机型？\"\n\n\"伊朗现役战机中仅有苏-24具备足够航程执行该区域打击任务。但他们也可能派遣F-4Phantom战机，甚至大规模编队的虎式战机，由雄猫或支点护航。近日这些机型均有出勤记录，但均未针对我军或盟军目标。目前唯一未现身的机型是米格-35。\"\n\n副联队长再次起身。\n\n\"感谢中校\"——他转向飞行员们——\"鉴于上述情况，联队长决定始终保持两架大黄蜂处于警戒7状态，另两架保持警戒30状态\"——他刻意忽略了房间里的低声抱怨，虽然这完全在意料之中。在波斯湾的甲板上全副武装待命——即便是春季——也绝非飞行员们向往的任务。\n\n\"我们将实行3小时轮班制，每6小时轮换中队。请各位指挥官在凌晨1点前提交未来24小时的值班表。有问题吗？很好。回去向你们的中队传达吧。\"",

  "Ready Room 6\nUSS Valley Forge \n1429 local\n\nThe Moonshadows' ready room didn't look that different from the Ravens' one, even though they were a Marine squadron. Flip sat in the first row, looking around as he waited for the intel brief to begin. Due to the flurry of missions and assignments, this particular sortie was a joint VMFA-262 and VFA-64 operation. Exactly at 1430 the familiar face of Lieutenant JG McHardy appeared on the CCTV screen. \n\n\"Welcome Tomahawk to this event 4 brief. CSG-4 is in the Gulf of Oman, tasked with degrading Iranian naval, air and ground-based A2/AD capabilities. The goal is to ensure freedom of navigation in the area and especially in the Strait of Hormuz. \n\nThe weather is fair, with scattered clouds at 7500 feet. Temperature is 24 degrees Celsius. Eastern wind, at 8 knots. \n\nEvent four CASE I launches will commence shortly after 1700, and the recovery is planned for 18:15 in CASE I as well. Carrier Strike Group is heading west and should be at the coordinates listed on the screen during departures and recoveries (Snapshot 2).\n\nAs for the restricted airspace, the rules have changed in the last 24 hours. Most of the Gulf Council States recognised Iran as a legitimate threat and have authorised the presence of US jets in their airspace.\n\nWe are planning to launch two flights during event 4. Scabbard 11 will consist of 2 Moonshadow Hornets and will perform a Combat Air Patrol. Sword 21 will be main strike force with four Hornets, two from Moonshadows and two from Ravens. The primary task for Sword will be to destroy three SA-15 launchers positioned on Greater Tunb island. Secondary task is to eliminate an Iranian search radar deployed on Lesser Tunb island. \n\nStrike will be the controlling agency for this mission.\n\nROE remains unchanged. You are cleared to engage the main and secondary target, namely the SA-15 systems (Topaz) and Search Radar (Sapphire). You are also free to engage any Iranian fighters that are a threat to the strikers or show hostile intent. Finally, in line with the main goal of our current operations, any Iranian navy assets spotted in open waters: Grisha class corvettes, fast movers and especially Kilo-class submarines, are all valid targets. \n\nThat is all from my side.

  "As McHardy disappeared from view, Lt Colonel Nash - CO of the Moonshadows, better known by his callsign \"Shag\" - took the floor. Nash was a bald, broad-shouldered marine, revered by his squadron mates and well liked by other aviators. (Snapshot 3) \n\n\"Alright, listen up, people. I don't know how you feel, but I'm certainly fed up with all the chirping of my RWR whenever I enter the Persian Gulf and get close to the Iranian islands over there. Three out of four - namely Greater Tunb, Smaller Tunb and Abu Musa - still house some kinds of Iranian radars and / or SAM systems. The one on Sirri\" - he pointed to the westernmost point on the map - \"was destroyed a few days ago by our Special Forces guys on the ground, who initially had a hard time getting out of there, but with a little help from the Ravens here, we brought them back safely\".\n\n\"OK, the lineup. We are two Moonshadows and two Ravens for this hop, our tactical callsign will be Sword. I'll be Sword 21, flying in 201. Kwiff will fly on my wing as Sword 22 in 203. Second element will be lead by Flip as Sword 23, jet number 403. Finally, NTTTY as Sword 24 in 411. \n\nWe will walk at 1630, plan to crank around 1700. Radio checks at 1705, and start taxiing soon after. We will rendezvous directly over our holding point, which is waypoint 1. \n\nShag nodded at the duty officer, who brought up another map on the screen (Snapshot 4).\n\n\"We'll hold a pattern at waypoint 1, with 1000 feet separation. I'll take Angels 20, Kwiff Angels 21, Flip Angels 22 and NTTTY Angels 23. Use that orbit to set up your HARMs and put your FLIR on the target area. Our push time is 1720 and we will spread out as shown on this map\". \n\nAgain, he gestured with his hand towards the black lines signifying flight paths of the strikers. \n\n\"The plan is to make things difficult for those guys at TOPAZ and shoot at them from different directions. That is why each of us needs to pay particular attention to correct timing at the IP. We'll shoot and call the shots in order, from 21 to 24. As there are four of us with 12 missiles to share between three different targets, we'll need to discuss the aim points\".\n\nHe gestured to the duty officer and another diagram appeared on the screen (Snapshot 5).\n\nThis is the location of our targets - provided they did not move in the last 4 hours. On the run-in, I want everyone to put FLIR on his respective target and make sure you have the correct one selected as a target for your HARMs. You have the coordinates, general location and info for who is responsible for hitting what. \n\nRemember, those SA-15s are pretty damn capable of shooting down our missiles and can do it quickly. That is why we need four HARMs launched at each target at the same time to ruin the bad guys day. Expect a lot of SAMs going up in the air against our HARMs and stay outside their attack envelope. \n\nI am responsible for Topaz 2, Sword 22 and 23 will fire two missiles each on Topaz 1, while Sword 24 will engage Topaz 3.\n\nNow if for some reason the HARMs don't do their job, 22 and 23 will be both carrying a pair of 65 echoes for a second run, but that one we'll set up on the go depending on what survives the first wave.\n\nHere's another look at the imagery, taken at 1400 (snapshot 6).\n\nThis is the approximate view from the southeast and how we will see it on our FLIRS. Correlate this image to what you see on HARM page in TOO mode for correct attack parameters. \n\n\nNow, If everything goes to plan and all three SA-15s are destroyed, then we'll shoot the Laser Mavs at our secondary target, the search radar which we will call \"Sapphire\", located on the Lesser Tunb. This is the recon photo\".\n\nHe gestured once again and a new image appeared behind him almost immediately (snapshot 7). \n\nThere may be other targets of opportunity around the radar, but we're only interested in getting that sucker. It allows the Iranians to see way too much of what is going on in that part of the gulf and it needs to be taken out. \n\nWhile we are dealing with that, Scabbards will CAP north of our position and discourage any enemy fighters that may appear. You are cleared to engage any hostiles upon visual identification or if they open fire first. Coordinate with Knight\". \n\n\"Your weapon loadout is in the Card of the Day. Suffice to say that 21 and 24 will have 4 HARMs, two AIM-9s, ATFLIR and a centerline tank, while 22 and 23 will swap two of the HARMs for Laser Mavs. Your codes are also in the kneeboard, double-check and set up everything before the strike. Use your ATFLIR to lase on your own. \n\nFrequencies. We'll switch to Strike after takeoff on Pri and stay on Tactical on Aux. \n\nWeather is decent, with scattered clouds at 7500 feet and rather calm winds at the deck level. According to our weather experts, it is not going to change. When launching those Mavs, make sure to stay below the cloud cover. \n\nNow for the emergencies. UAE SAR assets are on high alert on the coast, Moreover, we have USS Robert Grady in the Gulf,  around 15 miles northwest from Ras al Khaimah. USS Tinian is also operating not far from Sir Abu Nuayr island further to the south with Ospreys and Super Stallions onboard. They also have Harriers and Cobras. \n\nLet's set joker to 6000, bingo at 3000. We'll have tanker on station which we may use in case of any additional tasking or on our way back to the Mother if we get thirsty. Any questions?\"\n\nThe Moonshadow pilot who would be flying as Flight Lead of Scabbard 11 raised his hand. \n\n\"Notso?\"\n\n\"Sir, can we expect any fighters sitting on the strips on one of those three islands?\"\n\n\"Negative, from what we have seen mostly transport planes and helicopters. However, we believe there may be Mig-29s, Phantoms and F-5s in Bandar Lengeh and Queshm Island. Anything else? No? Good. Let's go!\"\n\n---------- DESIGNER'S NOTES ----------\n\n1. Flight Lead will initiate COMMs check 3 minutes after mission start. \n\n2. You should indicate you are ready to taxi around 6 or 7 minutes after mission start.\n\n3.

  "(It is recommended to read Chapter 62 of the Raven One novel before flying this mission)\n\nReady Room 7\nUSS Valley Forge \n03:30 local\n\nReady Room 7 was packed to the brim with aviators, crews, intelligence officers and others. Saint and Flip sat in the first row together with Lt. Colonel Nash, callsign \"Shag\", CO of the Moonshadows, as well as Buccaneer's XO who would be leading a 4-ship Sledge 21 flight. CAG Swoboda was also present, sitting in the aisle seat of the front row.  Everyone present watched the CCTV screen. \n\n\"Welcome Tomahawk to the event 1 brief. CSG-4 is in the Gulf of Oman, and continues to degrade Iranian naval, air and ground-based A2/AD capabilities.  The goal of this mission is to destroy the Iranian missile final assembly facility in south-central Iran at Yaz Kernoum. The GCC countries suspect Iran is preparing for a strike using ballistic missiles, and the goal of this sortie is to prevent that from happening. \n\nThe weather is good, with clear skies and southeastern wind at 5 knots. Temperature is 18 degrees Celsius.\n\nCASE 3 launch at 0535 - you can find the ship's expected position on the screen (snapshot 2). Expected CASE 1 recovery time is 0800. Mother is steaming northwest and the estimated recovery position is also visible on the screen, please note it down. Due to the covert nature of this operation no divert airfield has been designated, but the nearest divert field is Al Minhad Airbase (Snapshot 2).\n\nThe strike package will consist of the following components. Anvil 11 flight -  four Raven Hornets and Sledge 21 flight - four Buccaneer Hornets, all self-escort and responsible for destroying the main target. Tron 51 is a single S-3B responsible for Electronic Warfare support. Tron 52 flight is two Moonshadows flying SEAD as primary and Air Interdiction as a secondary task. Finally, two diversion flights that will draw the attention of the Iranians and should cover the main package: Redeye 41 are two Bloodhounds S-3Bs and Cutlass 31 are two Buccaneer Hornets. They will orbit north of Mother and make themselves attractive to Iranian radars.\"\n\nAs LTJG McHardy was speaking, calling out the flights, some pilots would nod hearing their callsigns. Few were taking notes on their kneeboards. Flip closed his eyes, focusing on the mission ahead, while Saint sat motionless, staring at the screen. \n\n\"Moreover, we will have support provided by USAF - two dedicated KC-135 Stratotankers, callsign Shell 11 and 21, and two flights of F-15Cs, Callsign Screamer 11 and 21. \n\nROE is as follows: the strike package is cleared to engage and destroy the primary target, as well as any SAM threats along the way. All Iranian military aircraft detected on intercept course are considered hostile. \n\nIt is important to underline the absolute necessity to remain undetected until it is too late for the enemy to react. At 2200 yesterday an announcement was made that our current operations are over and therefore the element of surprise should be on our side. \n\nThat is all from me - thank you for your attention.\"" : "（建议先阅读《Raven One》小说第62章再执行本任务）\n\n7号待命室\n\"福吉谷\"号航母\n当地时间03:30\n\n7号待命室挤满了飞行员、机组成员、情报官和其他人员。SAINT和Flip与Moonshadows中队指挥官\"Shag\" Nash中校以及将率领四机编队Sledge 21的Buccaneer副中队长坐在第一排。联队长Swoboda也在场，坐在前排过道座位。所有人都注视着闭路电视屏幕。\n\n\"欢迎参加战斧行动第一阶段简报。CSG-4战斗群位于阿曼湾，持续削弱伊朗海军、空军和陆基反介入/区域拒止能力。本次任务目标是摧毁伊朗中南部亚兹德克尔努姆的导弹总装设施。海湾合作委员会国家怀疑伊朗正准备使用弹道导弹发动攻击，本次出击旨在阻止这一情况发生。\n\n天气状况良好，晴空，东南风5节，气温18摄氏度。\n\n0535进行CASE 3弹射起飞 - 舰船预期位置见屏幕（截图2）。预计CASE 1回收时间0800。母舰正向西北航行，预计回收位置同样显示在屏幕上，请做好记录。由于行动隐蔽性要求，未指定备降机场，最近备降场为Al Minhad空军基地（截图2）。\n\nSTRIKE编队由以下单位组成：Anvil 11小队 - 四架Raven大黄蜂；Sledge 21小队 - 四架Buccaneer大黄蜂，均执行自卫护航并负责摧毁主要目标。Tron 51是单架S-3B，负责电子战支援。Tron 52小队是两架Moonshadows，主要执行防空压制，次要任务空中遮断。最后是两支佯动分队：Redeye 41为两架Bloodhounds S-3B，Cutlass 31为两架Buccaneer大黄蜂。他们将在母舰以北空域巡逻，吸引伊朗雷达注意。\"\n\n当McHardy中尉点名各分队时，听到自己呼号的飞行员纷纷点头。少数人正在膝板上做笔记。Flip闭目凝神专注于即将执行的任务，而SAINT一动不动地坐着，盯着屏幕。\n\n\"此外我们将获得美国空军支援 - 两架专用KC-135同温层加油机，呼号Shell 11和21；以及两个F-15C小队，呼号Screamer 11和21。\n\n交战规则如下：STRIKE编队获准攻击并摧毁主要目标，以及沿途任何防空导弹威胁。所有截击航向上的伊朗军用飞机均视为敌对目标。\n\n必须强调保持隐蔽的绝对必要性，直至敌人来不及反应。昨晚2200已宣布我方当前行动结束，因此突袭要素应在我们这边。\n\n我的汇报到此结束 - 感谢各位关注。\"",

  "Ready Room 7 fell silent and eyes of almost everyone gathered turned on Saint. He remained seated for a few more seconds, as if hesitating, then finally got up and walked to the front, shooting Flip a quick and meaningful glance. He cleared his throat and began his part of the briefing. \n\n\"Good morning, CAG. Air Wing Four is about to launch on probably the last mission of this air campaign, hours after an official declaration was made about all of our goals being fulfilled. The success of this strike heavily depends on our ability to remain undetected and this is why I and my team built the whole plan around this one goal.\" \n\nAt \"I and my team\" Flip saw Blade rolling his eyes. Wilson turned his attention back to the XO. \n\n\"I will walk you through it step by step, but first let's go through the basics. The aircraft assignments and parking spots will be discussed with your flight leaders. We will start at 0535 by launching Redeye and Cutlass flights, who will serve as a diversion and hopefully should get the attention of the Iranians, letting the rest slip under the radar. \n\nNow, very important : DO NOT energize your radars during startup. We will also launch ziplip until a later stage of the mission. If there is any sign that we are detected by the Iranians before we get feet dry,  the strike will have to be called off.\" \n\nEveryone scribbled notes on their kneeboards.\n\n\"After takeoff, the whole package will proceed to the staging area at waypoint 1. We have one spare Raven aircraft in case of trouble. 412 will join any flight that loses an aircraft as dash two  in case of Trons or dash four for Anvils and Sledges\". \n(Snapshot 3).\n\n\"At the staging point, each flight will be assigned a specific block, with 100 feet of separation between aircraft. Anvils will take between 2000 and 2300 feet AGL. Trons from 3000 to 3400 feet AGL. Sledges between 3600 and 3900 feet AGL. Exactly at 0550 the whole package will push towards waypoint 2\". \n\nSaint turned to the CO of the Bloodhounds.\n\n\"On the ingress we will keep 360 ground, which means we will be covering six miles per minute. As Tron 51 is the slowest in the lot, we will fly in formation off his wing. Trons 52 and 53 will stay with 51. Sledges will fly on the right, Anvils on the left and slightly in front of the rest. \n\nAfter the push, we will get in formation over the land, flying NOE. Once we clear the mountains and enter the Persian Gulf, we will descend below 1000 feet AGL. Again, let me stress how important it is that we are not detected - therefore each flight is required to stay below 5000 MSL over land and 1000 feet above water at all times on the way to waypoint 4. \n\nOnce we pass waypoint 3 we can energise our radars. I will give you a sign by dumping some fuel - the streak should be clearly visible in your NVGs. With the help of ground radars, we will avoid any maritime traffic along our way.  \n\nWhen we reach waypoint 4, we will receive a picture from Thor, a USAF E-3A. Each flight will acknowledge this call, which will serve as our radio check since we won't be having one on deck. This will be followed by the codeword telling us whether the mission is a go or should be cancelled. As I said before, if there is any sign that Iranians have detected us early and are setting up their defences or scrambling the fighters, we will need to turn back. \n\nIf we hear \"HOUSEBOAT\", we have a green light to proceed. \n\nIf Thor transmits \"THUNDERSTORM\", we will turn back to mother.\"\n\nImages behind Saint changed, showing the next stage of the attack (Snapshot 4).\n\n\"Once we get feet dry over Iran, I will transmit \"FLY BALL\" back to Thor, who will relay our progress to Strike. We will still stay low and in formation with Tron 51 until we reach waypoint 6, where Anvils, Sledges and Tron 52 will accelerate and climb to angels 16. At this stage, Tron 51 will stay behind the main package.\n\nUpon reaching waypoint 7 we will slave ATFLIRs to the target and each pilot will identify his aimpoint. We will carry two GBU-10s each that we will drop simultaneously on each of the targets. Make sure that you set up laser codes accordingly before the attack, you will find the codes on your kneeboards. (Snapshot 5).\n\nHere is another look at the target area. Make sure that you are able to identify your own target at a glance. (Snapshot 6).\n\nAs soon as we drop, we will egress south-west towards waypoint 9.\n\nNow let's talk about the fuel. Our Joker will be set to 6000 pounds and this is where we should be when we get off target. This will be enough to get to Magenta track and rendezvous with Shell 51 and Shell 61 and to cover for some possible contingencies, like enemy fighters or additional SAM sites we would need to avoid. Speaking of contingencies - any questions before we move to cover those?\"\n\nSaint looked around the room and was obviously content to have the undivided attention of everyone gathered. As nobody had questions, he continued. (Snapshot 7).\n\n\"This is our full flight plan with all known surface to air threats. The SA-6 here\" - Saint tapped the ring south of Queshm island - \"will not be a factor. If we stay below 1000 feet AGL up to waypoint 4 we also won't be detected by the search radar here, as it is walled off from the sea by a range of mountains just beyond the shore. We have two confirmed SA-2 launchers defending our target here and here, but their capabilities should be sufficiently degraded by Tron 51's jamming. There are also unconfirmed reports about possible SA-6 and SA-15 in the AO, and we cannot exclude MANPADs, so keep your heads on a swivel, set up countermeasure programs and stay above angels 16 during the whole attack run. \n\nWe can also expect medium calibre AAA over Yaz Kernoum, similar to what some of you have seen over Bandar Abbas, as well as ZU-23s and ZSU-23s, though the latter threat won't be a factor as long as everyone sticks to the briefed hard deck of 16,000 feet.\n\nAnother possible and real threat are bandits taking off from Shiraz. Each flight carries AIM-9s and some AIM-120s for self-protection. However, if any fighters are scrambled and try to intercept, we will detach Sledge 23 and 24 to take care of the air picture. This will reduce our potential impact on the Rock, but it is a risk we need to accept.  If there are more bandits headed our way, we will send Tron 52 against them. It is imperative that all Anvils and remaining Sledges drop their bombs before engaging enemy fighters\".\n\nShag raised his hand.\n\n\"Colonel?\"\n\n\"In case of trouble, can we get Screamers to come to our posit and help?\"\n\n\"Negative, unless we need to launch a CSAR, they will stay with Shell. So far Iranians were not very aggressive - and the only major aerial attack they launched did cost them dearly, as they lost 12 aircraft. We do not expect major opposition. Anything else?\"\n\nSilence. \n\n\"Good. Continuing with the contingencies - let's cover the CSAR I mentioned. USS Robert Grady is in the Persian Gulf with Switchblade onboard and they will be covering any extractions. Screamer will provide air cover, and Harriers from USS Tinian are on alert to provide CAS. Your emergency radios are tuned to Red 1, which is 145.250. In case of trouble, we have Red 2 and Red 3 channels as a backup. \n\nThat will be all from my side, stay sharp and focused. Now proceed with your flight briefings.\"\n\n---------- DESIGNER'S NOTES ----------\n\n1. Use CAT 1 or CAT 2 and wait for Anvil flight to take off. Best to take off as one of the last flights. \n\n2. You are briefed to go as Anvil 13 but should Saint be out for any reason, then you will jump in as Anvil 11 (Weed will remain 12, Blade becomes 13 and Dutch 14). In that case you will attack Saint's targets! \n\n3. DO NOT use autostart option as it will turn your radar on during the startup sequence. Start manually (sorry!).\n\n4. Estimated mission length: 70 minutes" : "简报室7陷入寂静，几乎所有人的目光都聚焦在SAINT身上。他又坐了几秒，仿佛在犹豫，最后起身走向前方，朝FLIP投去一个意味深长的眼神。清了清嗓子后，他开始进行任务简报。\n\n\"早上好，CAG。第四航母舰载机联队即将执行本次空袭行动的最后任务，尽管官方已宣布达成所有作战目标。此次打击的成功关键在于保持隐蔽性，这也正是我和团队制定整个计划的核心。\"\n\n当说到\"我和团队\"时，FLIP注意到BLADE翻了个白眼。威尔逊将注意力转回执行官。\n\n\"我将逐步讲解计划，首先说基础事项。各飞行编队飞机分配与停机位安排将与领队讨论。0535时首先弹射Redeye和CUTLASS小队，他们将执行佯攻任务吸引伊朗人注意，让主力部队避开雷达侦测。\"\n\n\"特别注意：启动时严禁开启雷达。在任务后期阶段前保持无线电静默。若在进入内陆前出现任何被伊朗发现的迹象，必须立即中止行动。\"\n\n众人都在膝板上快速记录。\n\n\"起飞后整个编队将前往航点1的集结区。我们备有一架备用渡鸦战机应对突发状况。412号机将作为替补——若Tron小队损失战机就作为2号机，IRON或SLEDGE小队缺编则作为4号机。\"\n\n\"在集结区，各编队将按高度层分配：IRON2000-2300英尺AGL；Tron3000-3400英尺AGL；SLEDGE3600-3900英尺AGL。0550整全编队向航点2推进。\"\n\nSAINT转向血猎犬中队的指挥官：\n\n\"进入时将保持360节地速，每分钟前进6海里。由于Tron51速度最慢，各机需与其保持编队飞行。Tron52和53伴随51号机。SLEDGE小队位于右侧，IRON小队在左前方。\"\n\n\"进入陆地后保持超低空飞行。越过山脉进入波斯湾时高度降至1000英尺AGL以下。再次强调隐蔽性——陆地阶段不得突破5000英尺MSL，水域阶段保持1000英尺高度直至航点4。\"\n\n\"经过航点3后可以激活雷达。我将通过燃油排泄发出信号，夜视镜中可见明显尾迹。借助地面雷达避开航线上的海上目标。\"\n\n\"到达航点4时将接收美军E-3A预警机'THOR'的情报。各编队需回复确认，这代替甲板上的无线电检查。之后将收到行动继续或中止的暗语。若发现伊军提前察觉并部署防御，必须立即撤退。\"\n\n\"若听到'HOUSEBOAT'则继续行动；若收到'THUNDERSTORM'则立即返航。\"\n\nSAINT身后的屏幕切换至下一阶段作战图示。\n\n\"进入伊朗领空后，我将向THOR发送'FLY BALL'汇报进展。保持编队飞行直至航点6，届时IRON、SLEDGE和Tron52将加速爬升至16000英尺。Tron51则留在主编队后方。\"\n\n\"抵达航点7时用ATFLIR锁定目标，每机携带两枚GBU-10激光制导炸弹同时投放。注意提前设置膝板上的激光编码。\"\n\n\"这是目标区详图，必须快速识别各自目标。\"\n\n\"投弹后立即向西南方向撤退至航点9。\"\n\n\"燃油方面，保留6000磅作为警戒油量，这能确保我们抵达洋红航线与谢尔51/61加油机会合，并应对可能的敌机或额外防空威胁。关于应急预案——有问题吗？\"\n\nSAINT环视房间，对全员专注的状态表示满意。见无人提问后继续：\n\n\"这是标有已知防空威胁的完整航线。格什姆岛南部的SA-6无需担心。只要在航点4前保持1000英尺以下高度，海岸山脉会阻挡搜索雷达。目标区确认有两处SA-2阵地，但Tron51的电子干扰足以压制。另有可能存在SA-6、SA-15及单兵防空导弹，务必保持警惕，设置对抗程序，攻击阶段维持16000英尺高度。\"\n\n\"亚兹克尔努姆预计有中口径高炮，类似你们在阿巴斯港遭遇的类型，还有ZU-23和ZSU-23。但只要遵守16000英尺最低高度，后者不成威胁。\"\n\n\"另一潜在威胁是设拉子起飞的敌机。各编队携带AIM-9和AIM-120自卫。若遭遇拦截，将派SLEDGE23/24应对。这会削弱对目标的打击效果，但必须接受。若敌机数量增多，Tron52将加入拦截。关键点是所有IRON和剩余SLEDGE成员必须优先完成投弹。\"\n\n沙格举手提问：\"上校，遇险时能否呼叫SCREAMER支援？\"\n\n\"除非需要战斗搜救，否则SCREAMER将留守加油区。目前伊朗空军并不激进，上次大规模出击让他们损失了12架战机。预计不会遭遇强烈抵抗。还有其他问题吗？\"\n\n沉默。\n\n\"好的。关于应急预案——战斗搜救部分：USS罗伯特·格雷迪号巡洋舰搭载的Switchblade小队负责营救，SCREAMER提供空中掩护，提尼安号的两栖攻击舰上的鹞式战机随时提供近距支援。紧急无线电频道调至红1（145.250），备用频道为红2和红3。\"\n\n\"我的部分到此结束，保持警惕。现在开始各小队简报。\"\n\n---------- 设计师说明 ----------\n\n1. 使用CAT 1或CAT 2弹射器，等待IRON小队先起飞。建议最后几个起飞。\n\n2. 你被指定为IRON13，若SAINT无法出战则替补为IRON11（WEED仍为12，BLADE变为13，DUTCH14）。此时需攻击SAINT的目标！\n\n3. 禁用自动启动选项——它会开启雷达。必须手动启动（抱歉！）\n\n4. 预计任务时长：70分钟",

  "Ready Room 7 fell silent and eyes of almost everyone gathered turned on Saint. He remained seated for a few more seconds, as if hesitating, then finally got up and walked to the front, shooting Flip a quick and meaningful glance. He cleared his throat and began his part of the briefing. \n\n\"Good morning, CAG. Air Wing Four is about to launch on probably the last mission of this air campaign, hours after an official declaration was made about all of our goals being fulfilled. The success of this strike heavily depends on our ability to remain undetected and this is why I and my team built the whole plan around this one goal.\" \n\nAt \"I and my team\" Flip saw Blade rolling his eyes. Wilson turned his attention back to the XO. \n\n\"I will walk you through it step by step, but first let's go through the basics. The aircraft assignments and parking spots will be discussed with your flight leaders. We will start at 0535 by launching Redeye and Cutlass flights, who will serve as a diversion and hopefully should get the attention of the Iranians, letting the rest slip under the radar. \n\nNow, very important : DO NOT energize your radars during startup. We will also launch ziplip until a later stage of the mission. If there is any sign that we are detected by the Iranians before we get feet dry,  the strike will have to be called off.\" \n\nEveryone scribbled notes on their kneeboards.\n\n\"After takeoff, the whole package will proceed to the staging area at waypoint 1. We have one spare Raven aircraft in case of trouble. 412 will join any flight that loses an aircraft as dash 2 two in case of Trons or dash four for Anvils and Sledges\".\n\n\"At the staging point, each flight will be assigned a specific block, with 100 feet of separation between aircraft. Anvils will take between 2000 and 2300 feet AGL. Trons from 3000 to 3400 feet AGL. Sledges between 3600 and 3900 feet AGL. Exactly at 0550 the whole package will push towards waypoint 2\". \n\n\"On the ingress we will keep 360 ground, which means we will be covering six miles per minute. As Tron 51 is the slowest in the lot, we will fly in formation off his wing. Trons 52 and 53 will stay with 51. Sledges will fly on the right, Anvils on the left and slightly in front of the rest. \n\nAfter the push, we will get in formation over the land, flying NOE. Once we clear the mountains and enter the Persian Gulf, we will descend below 1000 feet AGL. Again, let me stress how important it is that we are not detected - therefore each flight is required to stay below 1000 feet AGL at all times on the way to waypoint 4. \n\nOnce we pass waypoint 3 we can energise our radars. I will give you a sign by dumping some fuel - the streak should be clearly visible in your NVGs. With the help of ground radars, we will avoid any maritime traffic along our way.  \n\nWhen we reach waypoint 4, we will receive a picture from Thor, a USAF E-3A. Each flight will acknowledge this call, which will serve as our radio check since we won't be having one on deck. This will be followed by the codeword telling us whether the mission is a go or should be cancelled. As I said before, if there is any sign that Iranians have detected us early and are setting up their defences or scrambling the fighters, we will need to turn back. \n\nIf we hear \"HOUSEBOAT\", we have a green light to proceed. \n\nIf Thor transmits \"THUNDERSTORM\", we will turn back to mother.\"\n\nImages behind Saint changed, showing the next stage of the attack.\n\n\"Once we get feet dry over Iran, I will transmit \"FLY BALL\" back to Thor, who will relay our progress to Strike. We will still stay low and in formation with Tron 51 until we reach waypoint 6, where Anvils, Sledges and Tron 52 will accelerate and climb to angels 16. At this stage, Tron 51 will stay behind the main package.\n\nUpon reaching waypoint 7 we will slave ATFLIRs to the target and each pilot will identify his aimpoint. We will carry two GBU-10s each that we will drop simultaneously on each of the targets. Make sure that you set up laser codes accordingly before the attack, you will find the codes on your kneeboards.\n\nAs soon as we drop, we will egress south-west towards waypoint 9. ,\n\nNow let's talk about the fuel. Our Joker will be set to 7000 pounds and this is where we should be when we get off target. This will be enough to get to Magenta track and rendezvous with Shell 51 and Shell 61 and to cover for some possible contingencies, like enemy fighters or additional SAM sites we would need to avoid. Speaking of contingencies - any questions before we move to cover those?\"\n\nSaint looked around the room and was obviously content to have the undivided attention of everyone gathered. As nobody had questions, he continued. \n\n\"This is our full flight plan with all known surface to air threats. The SA-6 here\" - Saint tapped the ring south of Queshm island - \"will not be a factor. If we stay below 1000 feet AGL we also won't be detected by the search radar here, as it is walled off from the sea by a range of mountains just beyond the shore. We have two confirmed SA-2 launchers defending our target here and here, but their capabilities should be sufficiently degraded by Tron 51's jamming. There are also unconfirmed reports about possible SA-6 and SA-15 in the AO, and we cannot exclude MANPADs, so keep your heads on a swivel, set up countermeasure programs and stay above angels 16 during the whole attack run. \n\nWe can also expect medium calibre AAA over Yaz Kernoum, similar to what some of you have seen over Bandar Abbas, as well as ZU-23s and ZSU-23s, though the latter threat won't be a factor as long as everyone sticks to the briefed hard deck of 16,000 feet.\n\nAnother possible and real threat are bandits taking off from Shiraz. Each flight carries AIM-9s and some AIM-120s for self-protection. However, if any fighters are scrambled and try to intercept, we will detach Sledge 23 and 24 to take care of the air picture. This will reduce our potential impact on the Rock, but it is a risk we need to accept.  If there are more bandits headed our way, we will send Tron 52 against them. It is imperative that all Anvils and remaining Sledges drop their bombs before engaging enemy fighters\".\n\nShag raised his hand.\n\n\"Colonel?\"\n\n\"In case of trouble, can we get Screamers to come to our posit and help?\"\n\n\"Negative, unless we need to launch a CSAR, they will stay with Shell. So far Iranians were not very aggressive - and the only major aerial attack they launched did cost them dearly, as they lost 12 aircraft. We do not expect major opposition. Anything else?\"\n\nSilence. \n\n\"Good. Continuing with the contingencies - let's cover the CSAR I mentioned. USS Robert Grady is in the Persian Gulf with Switchblade onboard and they will be covering any extractions. Screamer will provide air cover, and Harriers from USS Tinian are on alert to provide CAS. Your emergency radios are tuned to Red 1, which is 145.250. In case of trouble, we have Red 2 and Red 3 channels as a backup. \n\nThat will be all from my side, stay sharp and focused. Now proceed with your flight briefings\".\n\n---------- DESIGNER'S NOTES ----------\n\n1. Make sure you set up your countermeasures at the mission start\n\n2.  If bandits arrrive, do not engage before Flip tells Weed to turn and attack, wait for all the comms before to finish. \n\n3. Estimated mission length: 80 minutes" : "7号待命室陷入寂静，几乎所有人的目光都转向SAINT。他又静坐了几秒，似乎有些犹豫，最终起身走向前方，朝FLIP投去一个意味深长的眼神。清了清嗓子后，他开始进行任务简报。\n\n\"早上好，联队长。第四航空联队即将执行的，很可能是本次空中战役的最后一次任务——尽管官方已宣布我们达成了所有作战目标。此次打击的成功，关键在于我们能否保持隐蔽，这也正是我和团队围绕这一核心制定整个计划的原因。\"\n\n当他说到\"我和团队\"时，FLIP注意到BLADE翻了个白眼。威尔逊将注意力转回副联队长。\n\n\"我会逐步讲解细节，但首先明确基础事项。飞行编组与停机位安排将由各分队领队具体说明。0535时首先弹射Redeye与CUTLASS分队担任佯攻，希望能吸引伊朗人注意，让主力部队避开雷达侦测。\"\n\n\"现在重点强调：启动时严禁开启雷达。在任务后期阶段前保持无线电静默。若在进入内陆前出现任何暴露迹象，必须中止打击行动。\"\n\n众人都在膝板上快速记录。\n\n\"起飞后整个攻击群将前往1号航路点的集结区。我们预备了一架备用Raven战机应对突发状况。412号机将随时替补：担任Tron分队2号机或IRON/SLEDGE分队的4号机。\"\n\n\"在集结区，各分队将按指定高度层编队，机间保持100英尺间隔。IRON分队飞行高度2000-2300英尺；Tron分队3000-3400英尺；SLEDGE分队3600-3900英尺。0550时整，全体向2号航路点推进。\"\n\n\"突入阶段保持地面速度360节，即每分钟6海里。由于Tron51是编队最慢单位，各机以其翼尖为基准保持队形。Tron52/53与长机保持编队，SLEDGE分队居右，IRON分队居左且略微突前。\"\n\n\"进入内陆后保持超低空飞行。越过山脉进入波斯湾时需降至1000英尺以下。再次强调隐蔽性至关重要——前往4号航路点途中必须全程保持此高度。\"\n\n\"通过3号航路点后可激活雷达。我将通过燃油喷射发出信号，夜视镜中可见明显尾迹。借助地面雷达规避航道上的海上目标。\"\n\n\"抵达4号航路点时，将接收美军E-3A预警机'THOR'的情报更新。各分队需应答确认，这替代甲板无线电检查。之后将收到决定任务继续/中止的暗语。若发现伊方早期预警并组织防御，立即撤退。\"\n\n\"若听到'HOUSEBOAT'，继续执行；'THUNDERSTORM'则返航。\"\n\nSAINT身后屏幕切换至攻击阶段示意图。\n\n\"进入伊朗领空后，我将向THOR发送'FLY BALL'通报进展。保持低空编队跟随Tron51直至6号航路点，届时IRON、SLEDGE及Tron52将爬升至16000英尺。Tron51保持滞后。\"\n\n\"到达7号航路点后，用ATFLIR锁定各自目标。每机携带两枚GBU-10激光制导炸弹同时投放，攻击前按膝板标注设置激光编码。\"\n\n\"投弹后立即向9号航路点西南方向脱离。\"\n\n\"油量设定：脱离目标区时最低保持7000磅，确保能抵达洋红航线与加油机51/61分队汇合，并应对可能的敌机拦截或新增防空阵地。关于应急预案——有问题吗？\"\n\nSAINT环视全场，对众人的专注表示满意。见无人提问便继续：\n\n\"完整航线已标注已知防空威胁。格什姆岛南部的SA-6\"——他敲击投影——\"无需顾虑。保持1000英尺以下可规避该处被海岸山脉遮挡的搜索雷达。目标区确认有两处SA-2阵地，Tron51的电子干扰足以压制。另有可能存在SA-6/15及单兵防空导弹，保持警惕，预设对抗程序，攻击阶段全程维持16000英尺高度。\"\n\n\"亚兹克尔努姆预计有类似阿巴斯港的中口径高炮及ZU/ZSU-23系统，但只要我们遵守16000英尺最低高度，后者构不成威胁。\"\n\n\"潜在威胁还包括设拉子起飞的敌机。各分队配备AIM-9和AIM-120自卫。若遭遇拦截，将指派SLEDGE23/24应对。这会削弱对岩体的打击效果，但属必要风险。若敌机增援，Tron52将迎击。必须确保所有IRON及剩余SLEDGE完成投弹后才能接战。\"\n\n沙格举手提问：\n\n\"上校，遇险时能否呼叫SCREAMER支援？\"\n\n\"除非需要战斗搜救，否则他们留守加油机位。目前伊方并不激进——上次大规模空袭让他们损失了12架战机。预计不会遭遇强烈抵抗。还有其他问题吗？\"\n\n沉默。\n\n\"继续应急预案说明：USS罗伯特·格雷迪号搭载的Switchblade小队负责搜救，SCREAMER提供空中掩护，提尼安号上的AV-8B随时准备近距离支援。紧急无线电调至红1频道145.250，备用红2/3频道。\"\n\n\"我的简报完毕，保持警惕。现在开始分队简报。\"\n\n---------- 设计者说明 ----------\n\n1.任务开始时务必设置对抗措施\n\n2.遭遇敌机时，必须等待FLIP下令WEED分队转向接战\n\n3.预计任务时长：80分钟",

  "Ready Room 7 fell silent and eyes of almost everyone gathered turned on Saint. He remained seated for a few more seconds, as if hesitating, then finally got up and walked to the front, shooting Flip a quick and meaningful glance. He cleared his throat and began his part of the briefing. \n\n\"Good morning, CAG. Air Wing Four is about to launch on probably the last mission of this air campaign, hours after an official declaration was made about all of our goals being fulfilled. The success of this strike heavily depends on our ability to remain undetected and this is why I and my team built the whole plan around this one goal.\" \n\nAt \"I and my team\" Flip saw Blade rolling his eyes. Wilson turned his attention back to the XO. \n\n\"I will walk you through it step by step, but first let's go through the basics. The aircraft assignments and parking spots will be discussed with your flight leaders. We will start at 0535 by launching Redeye and Cutlass flights, who will serve as a diversion and hopefully should get the attention of the Iranians, letting the rest slip under the radar. \n\nNow, very important : DO NOT energize your radars during startup. We will also launch ziplip until a later stage of the mission. If there is any sign that we are detected by the Iranians before we get feet dry,  the strike will have to be called off.\" \n\nEveryone scribbled notes on their kneeboards.\n\n\"After takeoff, the whole package will proceed to the staging area at waypoint 1. We have one spare Raven aircraft in case of trouble. 412 will join any flight that loses an aircraft as dash 2 two in case of Trons or dash four for Anvils and Sledges\".\n\n\"At the staging point, each flight will be assigned a specific block, with 100 feet of separation between aircraft. Anvils will take between 2000 and 2300 feet AGL. Trons from 3000 to 3400 feet AGL. Sledges between 3600 and 3900 feet AGL. Exactly at 0550 the whole package will push towards waypoint 2\". \n\n\"On the ingress we will keep 360 ground, which means we will be covering six miles per minute. As Tron 51 is the slowest in the lot, we will fly in formation off his wing. Trons 52 and 53 will stay with 51. Sledges will fly on the right, Anvils on the left and slightly in front of the rest. \n\nAfter the push, we will get in formation over the land, flying NOE. Once we clear the mountains and enter the Persian Gulf, we will descend below 1000 feet AGL. Again, let me stress how important it is that we are not detected - therefore each flight is required to stay below 1000 feet AGL at all times on the way to waypoint 4. \n\nOnce we pass waypoint 3 we can energise our radars. I will give you a sign by dumping some fuel - the streak should be clearly visible in your NVGs. With the help of ground radars, we will avoid any maritime traffic along our way.  \n\nWhen we reach waypoint 4, we will receive a picture from Thor, a USAF E-3A. Each flight will acknowledge this call, which will serve as our radio check since we won't be having one on deck. This will be followed by the codeword telling us whether the mission is a go or should be cancelled. As I said before, if there is any sign that Iranians have detected us early and are setting up their defences or scrambling the fighters, we will need to turn back. \n\nIf we hear \"HOUSEBOAT\", we have a green light to proceed. \n\nIf Thor transmits \"THUNDERSTORM\", we will turn back to mother.\"\n\nImages behind Saint changed, showing the next stage of the attack.\n\n\"Once we get feet dry over Iran, I will transmit \"FLY BALL\" back to Thor, who will relay our progress to Strike. We will still stay low and in formation with Tron 51 until we reach waypoint 6, where Anvils, Sledges and Tron 52 will accelerate and climb to angels 16. At this stage, Tron 51 will stay behind the main package.\n\nUpon reaching waypoint 7 we will slave ATFLIRs to the target and each pilot will identify his aimpoint. We will carry two GBU-10s each that we will drop simultaneously on each of the targets. Make sure that you set up laser codes accordingly before the attack, you will find the codes on your kneeboards.\n\nAs soon as we drop, we will egress south-west towards waypoint 9. ,\n\nNow let's talk about the fuel. Our Joker will be set to 7000 pounds and this is where we should be when we get off target. This will be enough to get to Magenta track and rendezvous with Shell 51 and Shell 61 and to cover for some possible contingencies, like enemy fighters or additional SAM sites we would need to avoid. Speaking of contingencies - any questions before we move to cover those?\"\n\nSaint looked around the room and was obviously content to have the undivided attention of everyone gathered. As nobody had questions, he continued. \n\n\"This is our full flight plan with all known surface to air threats. The SA-6 here\" - Saint tapped the ring south of Queshm island - \"will not be a factor. If we stay below 1000 feet AGL we also won't be detected by the search radar here, as it is walled off from the sea by a range of mountains just beyond the shore. We have two confirmed SA-2 launchers defending our target here and here, but their capabilities should be sufficiently degraded by Tron 51's jamming. There are also unconfirmed reports about possible SA-6 and SA-15 in the AO, and we cannot exclude MANPADs, so keep your heads on a swivel, set up countermeasure programs and stay above angels 16 during the whole attack run. \n\nWe can also expect medium calibre AAA over Yaz Kernoum, similar to what some of you have seen over Bandar Abbas, as well as ZU-23s and ZSU-23s, though the latter threat won't be a factor as long as everyone sticks to the briefed hard deck of 16,000 feet.\n\nAnother possible and real threat are bandits taking off from Shiraz. Each flight carries AIM-9s and some AIM-120s for self-protection. However, if any fighters are scrambled and try to intercept, we will detach Sledge 23 and 24 to take care of the air picture. This will reduce our potential impact on the Rock, but it is a risk we need to accept.  If there are more bandits headed our way, we will send Tron 52 against them. It is imperative that all Anvils and remaining Sledges drop their bombs before engaging enemy fighters\".\n\nShag raised his hand.\n\n\"Colonel?\"\n\n\"In case of trouble, can we get Screamers to come to our posit and help?\"\n\n\"Negative, unless we need to launch a CSAR, they will stay with Shell. So far Iranians were not very aggressive - and the only major aerial attack they launched did cost them dearly, as they lost 12 aircraft. We do not expect major opposition. Anything else?\"\n\nSilence. \n\n\"Good. Continuing with the contingencies - let's cover the CSAR I mentioned. USS Robert Grady is in the Persian Gulf with Switchblade onboard and they will be covering any extractions. Screamer will provide air cover, and Harriers from USS Tinian are on alert to provide CAS. Your emergency radios are tuned to Red 1, which is 145.250. In case of trouble, we have Red 2 and Red 3 channels as a backup. \n\nThat will be all from my side, stay sharp and focused. Now proceed with your flight briefings\".\n\n---------- DESIGNER'S NOTES ----------\n\n1. Make sure you set up your countermeasures at the mission start\n\n2.  If bandits arrive, do not engage before Flip tells Weed to turn and attack, wait for all the comms before that to finish. \n\n3. Estimated mission length: 80 minutes" : "7号简报室陷入寂静，几乎所有人都将目光投向SAINT。他又静坐了几秒，仿佛在犹豫，最终起身走向前方，朝FLIP投去一个意味深长的眼神。清嗓之后，他开始了任务简报部分。\n\n\"早上好，联队长。第四航空联队即将执行本次空袭战役的最终任务——尽管官方已宣布所有作战目标达成。此次行动成功的关键在于隐蔽突防，这也正是我和团队制定整个计划的核心原则。\"\n\n当他说到\"我和团队\"时，FLIP瞥见BLADE翻了个白眼。威尔逊重新将注意力转回副联队长。\n\n\"我将逐步讲解细节，但首先明确基础事项。各飞行编队的战机分配与停机位安排将由小队长具体部署。0535时率先弹射Redeye与Switchblade小队执行佯攻，吸引伊朗防空注意力，掩护主力编队突破雷达网。\n\n重点注意：启动时严禁开启雷达。无线电静默将保持至任务后期阶段。若在进入内陆前出现任何暴露迹象，必须立即中止行动。\"\n\n飞行员们纷纷在膝板上记录要点。\n\n\"起飞后整个STRIKE将集结于1号航路点。我们配备了一架备用渡鸦战机——若发生战损，412号机将作为Tron小队的2号机或IRON/SLEDGE小队的4号机补位。\"\n\n\"在集结空域，各编队将保持100英尺垂直间隔：IRON小队2000-2300英尺，Tron小队3000-3400英尺，SLEDGE小队3600-3900英尺。0550时整队向2号航路点推进。\"\n\n\"突袭航段保持360节地速，即每分钟6海里。由于Tron51是编队最慢单位，各机将以其为基准保持队形。Tron52、53与长机保持编组，SLEDGE小队居右，IRON小队居左且略微突前。\"\n\n\"进入内陆后保持超低空飞行。越过山脉进入波斯湾时需降至1000英尺以下。再次强调隐蔽性至关重要——抵达4号航路点前所有编队必须持续保持该高度。\"\n\n\"通过3号航路点后允许开启雷达。我将通过燃油排泄发出信号——夜视镜中可见明显尾迹。借助地面雷达规避航线上的海上目标。\"\n\n\"抵达4号航路点时将接收美军E-3A'THOR'预警机的战场态势。各编队需应答呼叫，这替代甲板无线电检查。随后将收到行动继续/中止的暗号。若发现伊方早期预警并组织防御，必须立即返航。\"\n\n\"若听到'HOUSEBOAT'则按计划推进。\"\n\n\"若THOR发出'THUNDERSTORM'则立即撤回母舰。\"\n\nSAINT背后的屏幕切换至攻击阶段示意图。\n\n\"进入伊朗领空后，我将向THOR发送'FLY BALL'通报进展。编队继续以Tron51为基准保持低空飞行，直至6号航路点——届时IRON、SLEDGE及Tron52将加速爬升至16000英尺。Tron51留守主力编队后方。\"\n\n\"到达7号航路点时，用ATFLIR光电系统锁定目标并确认各自打击点。每机携带两枚GBU-10激光制导炸弹同时投掷，攻击前务必按膝板标注设置激光编码。\"\n\n\"投弹后立即向9号航路点西南方向脱离。\"\n\n\"油量方面，Joker警戒值设定为7000磅——这是脱离目标区时应保持的最低油量，足以支撑我们抵达洋红航线与Shell51、61加油机汇合，并应对可能的敌机拦截或额外防空威胁。关于应急预案——在进入该环节前有问题吗？\"\n\nSAINT环视全场，对众人的专注表示满意。见无人提问后继续：\n\n\"这是标注所有已知防空威胁的完整航线。此处SA-6——\"他敲击格什姆岛南部的圆圈标记，\"只要保持1000英尺以下就不会构成威胁。沿岸山脉将阻隔该搜索雷达对海探测。目标区确认有两处SA-2发射阵地，但Tron51的电子干扰足以压制其效能。战区可能还存在未确认的SA-6、SA-15及单兵防空导弹，务必保持警惕，预设对抗程序，攻击全程维持16000英尺高度。\"\n\n\"亚兹克尔努姆地区预计存在中口径高炮，类似你们在阿巴斯港遭遇的类型，以及ZU-23与ZSU-23高炮——但只要遵守16000英尺最低攻击高度，后者可忽略不计。\"\n\n\"另一现实威胁是设拉子起飞的敌机。各编队配备AIM-9和AIM-120用于自卫。若遭遇拦截，将分遣SLEDGE23、24应对空情，这会削弱对岩体的打击效果，但属必要风险。若出现更多敌机，Tron52将前往拦截。必须确保所有IRON及剩余SLEDGE成员在接战前完成投弹。\"\n\n沙格举手提问：\n\n\"上校，若遇险情，能否调SCREAMER小队支援？\"\n\n\"除非需要战斗搜救，否则他们将留守SHELL加油机。目前伊朗空军表现消极——上次大规模出击让他们损失了12架战机。预计不会遭遇强烈抵抗。还有其他问题吗？\"\n\n沉默。\n\n\"很好。继续应急预案——关于战斗搜救：波斯湾的USS罗伯特·格雷迪号搭载着利刃小队负责救援，SCREAMER提供空中掩护，提尼安号的鹞式战机随时可提供近距支援。应急无线电调至Red1频道145.250，备用Red2、3频道。\"\n\n\"我的部分到此结束，保持专注。现在开始各编队简报。\"\n\n---------- 设计者说明 ----------\n\n1. 任务开始时务必设置对抗措施\n\n2. 若遭遇敌机，在FLIP命令WEED转向接战前不得擅自行动，等待完整通讯流程\n\n3. 预计任务时长：80分钟",
